The major chunk of them was developed in the last decade. Those are all working in different algorithms like proof of stake or proof of work, there are dozen more algorithms available over the internet!What is CryptocurrenciesAccording to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions  The system does not require a Central Authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.  The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.  The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.  Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.  The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.  If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.There are numerous things more which we need to understand to know more about the working of cryptocurrencies.

            "title": "How Blockchain Could Disrupt Banking Industry?",
            "summary": "This blog contains details that deal with the results of using blockchain technology in the banking industry. There are many references included in the blog which are from one of the topmost financial institutions like JP Morgan and Chase.",
            "content_text": "In today’s day and age, banks are the most important key point in the whole finance ecosystem where they serve as the critical storehouses and transfer hubs of value. Now with the induction of Blockchain in this domain, the role of banks in the transaction and the value of fiat currency is going down day by day hence there could be a scenario where blockchain could propose a big threat to large institutions like JP Morgan and Credit Suisse.What makes blockchain (so) disruptive for banks?The answer to this question lies in the three specific in-build properties of a blockchain: Decentralized, distributed and Immutability. These differ completely from those of banks that are centralized organizations.      Decentalized Network Blockchain operates on a decentralized network, that is acting on a peer-to-peer basis. It handles all operations similar to a bank, but without any central authority that monitors all data. So it potentially cuts out the middleman, giving back the power to the owner of the assets (i.e. data or tokens carrying some financial value). All information is stored across its network via blocks. These blocks, which are time-stamped and linked together with all past and current transactions, are permanently recorded and consistently reconciled and updated in a cryptographically secure way. By storing data across its network, blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally.        Distributed LedgerA second property of blockchain is the distributed ledger, that allows sharing of a ledger of activity - such as arbitrary data or virtually anything of value between multiple parties. What makes blockchain so important is its ability to automate trust and transparency among all parties using it. Because the ledger is distributed among all transaction participants, it exists simultaneously in multiple places. Each of the computers in the distributed network maintains a copy of the ledger to ensure transparency and also prevent a single point of failure and all copies are updated and validated simultaneously. This makes it extremely difficult to manipulate entries or tamper with the data without the other parties noticing.        Immutable Records A third unique property is its immutability. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of data. All blockchain networks adhere to a certain protocol for validating new blocks. No changes can be made once the system is set with the initial standards. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered without the alteration of all the subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of the network majority.  Where will be blockchain hit on the Banks ??Though blockchain is said to have an impact on virtually every aspect of the financial system, most disruptive use cases can be found in activities such as cross border payments and remittances, share trading, clearing and settlement, trade finance and supply chain finance, regulatory reporting and compliance, as well as smart contracts. It is however clear that when the technology further evolves there will be many more areas for applying the blockchain technologies emerging.      Cross border payments  It is not surprising that payments are emerging as the first and foremost blockchain use case of any banking and/or financial system. Nowadays payments across borders are a time-consuming and expensive process, given the need for correspondent banks or other intermediaries.    Blockchain offers an easy and secure solution, as it will not require third party authorization. . By cutting out many of the traditional middlemen, the laborious and costly process of cross border payments is simplified, thus significantly speeding up the cross-border payment process and that at a cost much less than with the traditional banking systems.        Share Trading  Using blockchain for buying and selling stocks and shares could also bring several significant benefits. Share trading involves many third parties, such as brokers, CCPs, CSDs and exchanges, making this process time-consuming.    The decentralized nature of blockchain technology can remove all those intermediaries and enable trading to be run on computers all over the world. Eliminating some of the middlemen from the share trading process speeds up the settlement process and allows for greater trade accuracy. Trading transactions in blockchain thereby reduces the redundancy of information and thus improves performance.        Clearing and settlement  The global cash settlement for fixed income, equity, and derivative products in various currencies is slow, costly, and complicated. Because of the large number of parties involved, It takes several days to settle.    By eliminating a large number of intermediaries, blockchain enables instantaneous settlement leading to substantially lower costs        Trade Finance  Many trade finance activities still involve lots of paperwork, such as bills of lading, invoices, letters of credit etc. All participants in the trade chain must maintain their database for all transaction-related documents, that must be constantly reconciled against each other. It is as a result a time-consuming activity.    Blockchain-based trade finance can streamline the entire trading process by getting rid of this time-consuming paperwork and bureaucracy. It eliminates the need for several copies of the same document and can integrate all necessary information in one digital document, which is updated in real-time and can be accessed by all network members.        Digital Identity Verification  Another area where customer experience could be significantly improved when using blockchain is in the digital identity verification process. Online financial transactions require a lot of steps to be taken, including face-to-face checking, authentication, authorization etc. All of these steps need to be taken for each new service provider.    Blockchain makes it possible to securely re-use identity verification for other services. With blockchain, users can choose how they identify themselves and with whom they agree to share their identity. They still need to register their identity on the blockchain, but they do not need to repeat the registration for each service provider if those providers are also powered by blockchain.        Smart Contracts  Smart contracts are another way to fundamentally change the way business is done nowadays. The functions of a bank such as lending, deposits, treasury, investment advice, business intelligence, regulatory compliance, payments, and remittances will be disrupted by using these contracts.    Through the use of smart contracts, blockchain technology will change the way information and money are exchanged in finance (and in many other industries). Smart contracts enable operating and automating business processes in a fully decentralized fashion, enabling shared rules of engagement, conduct, and business processes to be automated and enforced ecosystem-wide.        Intensive collaboration  The blockchain-based bank ecosystem will be one of intensive collaboration, within an increasingly open banking environment, not only with other banks but also with various third parties in the financial chain. Whether the third party is a payment processor, a fintech startup or a creative app developer.    Future success will depend on their willingness to co-operate – even with the apparent challengers to their core activities. Banks don’t have a choice in this – not if they want to survive and prosper. Although it might seem counterintuitive to banks to facilitate new services beyond their immediate control and balance sheets, standing in the way of external creativity and innovation carries the greater risk.        Bank-fintech partnerships  Even as the disruptions continue, the ecosystem will see deeper collaboration between financial institutions and fintech firms and the creation of platform companies to meet the changing needs of their customers. While fintech companies have the advantage of innovation, financial institutions provide a sandbox for proof of concept and scale.    Most fintech start-ups lack several features for a stand-alone existence, that are well known for traditional banks. Fintech firms need to be wary of product functionality, flexibility, scalability and compliance. Banks have the advantages of greater resources and a larger scale. Good partnerships between banks and fintech could bring the best for both worlds.  These are the domains in which banks could face the competition and could potentially lose ground against Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.REFERENCESCarlo R.W.

This means the individual holds power over the resource they want to verify on the blockchain. This could be in cryptos, certificate authentication, land titles, etc. The problem with this is if a transaction goes sour after it has already been verified on the blockchain, the only feasible way of returning the transaction is if the parties agree to reverse it. Using a  centralized system like a bank. However, there is a procedure in place to be able to dispute trades after they are complete. Some trade technologies that settle on a blockchain have used an arbiter system to fix this problem, an example of this is the Open Bazaar P2P  trade network. This way trade occurs between two people and one impartial moderator.2. Settlement on a blockchain is slow A  cost of settling a transaction on the blockchain is that all the nodes in the network need to come to an agreement that the transaction is valid. This is a far slower process than having a bank verify your transaction in an instant. Transactions can be made instantaneously, however until the block in which the transaction is inserted has been verified, it is classified as untrustworthy. In the time between a lodged transaction is made and when the block settles, a bad actor could launch fraudulent transactions to trick the network into what is known as double spend. A  very exciting upcoming technology that could solve this problem is the lightning network. This solution acts as layer 2 of blockchain technology; it can be applied to any public blockchain. It will enable instantly verified transactions for a fraction of the cost of today’s settlement.3. Miners can be selfish The mining process on the blockchain is an innovation that uses game theory economics to incentivize people to commit computer power for securing the network for a profit. The downside of this is generally miners won’t care about settling as many transactions as possible; they will make the most money by finding and verifying a block in the fastest way possible. This leads to a problem of miners finding empty blocks and validating. There is also another problem known as Selfish Mining, which is a situation where a miner or mining pool finds and validates a block and does not publish and distribute a valid solution to the rest of the network.4. The growing blockchain size  With  every new block, a blockchain grows. This can be an issue because each node that is validating the network needs to store the entire history of the blockchain to be a participant. This is a hard enough problem with the bitcoin blockchain where the transaction size is only a  few bytes, the total blockchain size as of January 2017 is 98GB. Given that at the same time in 2016 the size was 50GB, and the use of the blockchain is continuing to increase, this is a growing concern. One of the biggest debates in the bitcoin space is if the block size should be increased. If a blockchain has bigger blocks the blockchain size will increase faster, thus weeding out the solo miners eventually. This is a big issue because the health of a blockchain network is partially dependent on the number of nodes in the network, and the spread of those nodes across the world. The counterargument for this issue is that with sufficient advancement of technology hard disk space will be very cheap in the future and will stay ahead of the blockchain size. The debate is ongoing.5. Eventually, a settlement on the blockchain will not be cheap  On any public blockchain, space in a block is a finite resource.  Necessarily as the network is utilized more the amount of transactions that will want to settle in a block will exceed the storage capacity.  Public blockchain networks have a solution built-in for this which is that transactions with a higher miner fee attached will get precedence to be included in a block. This makes sense because the miners want to maximize their profit so that they will include transactions with the highest fees first. This is not a bug, but a feature. If it were free to settle on the blockchain, there would be far too many ways of attacking the blocks with dust transactions and clogging up the network. Originally the bitcoin blockchain had no block size limit; this was eventually set to  1MB to avoid a Sybil Attack on the network. All of these problems have potential solutions that can be implemented as a  fix. In my view, blockchains will eventually have layers of centralization like the lightning network. However, this is not a bad thing so long as there is a sufficient amount of encryption to protect the privacy of the people who want to use the centralized layers of the network.REFERENCESBlaetti, Robert. “5 Weak Points of Blockchain Technology.” Blockgeeks, 13 Jan. 2017, blockgeeks.com/public-blockchain/.‌",

            "content_text": "An initial coin offering (ICO) or initial currency offering is a type of funding using cryptocurrencies. It is often a form of crowdfunding, although a private ICO which does not seek public investment is also possible. In an ICO, a quantity of cryptocurrency is sold in the form of “tokens” (“coins”) to speculators or investors, in exchange for legal tender or other (generally established and more stable) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether. The tokens are promoted as future functional units of currency if or when the ICO’s funding goal is met and the project successfully launchesKEY TAKEAWAYS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a popular fundraising method used primarily by startups wishing to offer products and services, usually related to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.  ICOs are similar to stocks, but they sometimes have utility for a software service or product offered.  Some ICOs have yielded massive returns for investors. Numerous others have turned out to be fraud or have failed or performed poorly.  To participate in an ICO, you will usually need to purchase a digital currency first and have a basic understanding of how to use cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges.  ICOs are, for the most part, completely unregulated, so investors must exercise a high degree of caution and diligence when researching and investing in ICOs.How an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) WorksWhen a cryptocurrency startup wants to raise money through ICO, it usually creates a whitepaper that outlines what the project is about, the need the project will fulfill upon completion, how much money is needed, how many of the virtual tokens the founders will keep, what type of money will be accepted, and how long the ICO campaign will run for.During the ICO campaign, enthusiasts and supporters of the project buy some of the project’s tokens with fiat or digital currency. These coins are referred to the buyers as tokens and are similar to shares of a company sold to investors during an IPO.If the money raised does not meet the minimum funds required by the firm, the money may be returned to the backers; at this point, the ICO would be deemed unsuccessful. If the funding requirements are met within the specified timeframe, the money raised is used to pursue the goals of the project.Special Considerations Investors looking to buy into ICOs should first familiarize themselves with the cryptocurrency space more broadly. In the case of most ICOs, investors must purchase tokens with pre-existing cryptocurrencies. This means that an ICO investor will need to already have a cryptocurrency wallet set up for a currency like bitcoin or ethereum, as well as having a wallet capable of holding whichever token or currency they want to purchase.How are ICOs regulated?ICOs are largely unregulated. In the United States, there aren’t any regulations that apply specifically to ICOs. However, if an ICO fits the classification of a securities offering, then it falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction and is regulated by federal securities laws.Some countries have taken a strict stance and banned ICOs entirely. Countries that have banned ICOs include China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Macedonia, Bolivia, and Ecuador.REFERENCES:            “What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain      IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.

The tokens are promoted as future functional units of currency if or when the ICO’s funding goal is met and the project successfully launches</p><p>KEY TAKEAWAYS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</p><ul>  <li>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a popular fundraising method used primarily by startups wishing to offer products and services, usually related to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.</li>  <li>ICOs are similar to stocks, but they sometimes have utility for a software service or product offered.</li>  <li>Some ICOs have yielded massive returns for investors. Numerous others have turned out to be fraud or have failed or performed poorly.</li>  <li>To participate in an ICO, you will usually need to purchase a digital currency first and have a basic understanding of how to use cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges.</li>  <li>ICOs are, for the most part, completely unregulated, so investors must exercise a high degree of caution and diligence when researching and investing in ICOs.</li></ul><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">How an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Works</span></b><br />When a cryptocurrency startup wants to raise money through ICO, it usually creates a whitepaper that outlines what the project is about, the need the project will fulfill upon completion, how much money is needed, how many of the virtual tokens the founders will keep, what type of money will be accepted, and how long the ICO campaign will run for.</p><p>During the ICO campaign, enthusiasts and supporters of the project buy some of the project’s tokens with fiat or digital currency. These coins are referred to the buyers as tokens and are similar to shares of a company sold to investors during an IPO.</p><p>If the money raised does not meet the minimum funds required by the firm, the money may be returned to the backers; at this point, the ICO would be deemed unsuccessful. If the funding requirements are met within the specified timeframe, the money raised is used to pursue the goals of the project.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">Special Considerations </span></b><br />Investors looking to buy into ICOs should first familiarize themselves with the cryptocurrency space more broadly. In the case of most ICOs, investors must purchase tokens with pre-existing cryptocurrencies. This means that an ICO investor will need to already have a cryptocurrency wallet set up for a currency like bitcoin or ethereum, as well as having a wallet capable of holding whichever token or currency they want to purchase.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">How are ICOs regulated?</span></b><br />ICOs are largely unregulated. In the United States, there aren’t any regulations that apply specifically to ICOs. However, if an ICO fits the classification of a securities offering, then it falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction and is regulated by federal securities laws.</p><p>Some countries have taken a strict stance and banned ICOs entirely. Countries that have banned ICOs include China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Macedonia, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p><hr /><h4 id=\"references\">REFERENCES:</h4><table>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>“What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain</td>      <td>IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><p>Wikipedia Contributors. “Blockchain.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.</p><p>Wikipedia Contributors, “Initial coin offering,” Wikipedia, 08-Nov-2021.

            "content_text": "An atomic swap is a smart contract technology that enables the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without using centralized intermediaries, such as exchanges.Atomic swaps can take place directly between blockchains of different cryptocurrencies, or they can be conducted off-chain, away from the main blockchain. They first came into prominence in September 2017, when an atomic swap between Decred and Litecoin was conducted.Since then, other startups and decentralized exchanges have allowed users the same facility. For example, Lightning Labs, a startup that uses bitcoin’s lightning network for transactions, has conducted off-chain swaps using the technology.Cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges, such as 0x and Altcoin.io, have also incorporated the technology.How do atomic swaps work?Atomic swap protocols are designed in a way that prevents any of the involved parties from cheating. To understand how they work, let’s imagine that Alice wants to trade her Litecoins (LTC) for Bob’s Bitcoins (BTC).First, Alice deposits her LTC into a contract address that acts like a safe. When this safe is created, Alice also generates a key to access it. She then shares a cryptographic hash of this key with Bob. Note that Bob can’t access the LTC yet because he only has the hash of the key and not the key itself.Next, Bob uses the hash provided by Alice to create another safe contract address, in which he deposits his BTC. To claim the BTC, Alice is required to use that same key and, by doing so, she reveals it to Bob (thanks to a special function called hash lock). This means that as soon as Alice claims the BTC, Bob can claim the LTC and the swap is complete.The term ‘atomic’ relates to the fact that these transactions either happen entirely or not at all. If any of the parties give up or fail to do what they are supposed to, the contract is cancelled, and the funds are automatically returned to their owners.Atomic swaps can happen in two different ways: on-chain and off-chain. On-chain atomic swaps happen on either of the currency’s networks (in this case, either the Bitcoin or Litecoin blockchain). Off-chain atomic swaps, on the other hand, take place on a secondary layer. This kind of atomic swap is usually based on bidirectional payment channels, similar to the ones used in the Lightning Network.Technically speaking, most of these trustless trading systems are based on smart contracts that use multi-signatures and Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC).Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC)While Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC) are an important part of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, they are also one of the key components that makes atomic swaps possible. As the name suggests, they are based on two key functions: a hash lock and a timelock.A hash lock is what prevents funds from being spent unless a piece of data is revealed (Alice’s key in the previous example). Timelock is a function that ensures the contract can only be executed within a predefined timeframe. Consequently, the use of HTLCs removes the need for trust because they create a specific set of rules that prevent atomic swaps from executing partially.AdvantagesThe biggest advantages of atomic swaps are all related to their decentralized nature. By removing the need for a centralized exchange or any other kind of mediator, cross-chain swaps can be executed by two (or more) parties without requiring them to trust each other. There is also an increased level of security because users don’t need to give their funds to a centralized exchange or third party. Instead, the trades can happen directly from users’ wallets.Also, this form of peer-to-peer trading has much lower operational costs as trading fees are either very low or absent. Lastly, atomic swaps make it possible for trades to happen very quickly, with higher degrees of interoperability. In other words, altcoins can be swapped directly without making use of Bitcoin or Ethereum as an intermediary coin.LimitationsThere are a few conditions that need to be met for an atomic swap to take place, and these may likely present obstacles for the technique to be widely adopted. For instance, to perform an atomic swap, the two cryptocurrencies need to be based on blockchains that share the same hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256 for Bitcoin). They also need to be compatible with HTLC and other programmable functionalities.Other than that, atomic swaps bring up concerns about user’s privacy. That’s because on-chain swaps and transactions can be quickly tracked on a blockchain explorer, making it easy to link the addresses. A short-term answer to this problem is to use privacy-focused cryptocurrencies as a way to reduce exposure. Still, many developers are experimenting with the use of digital signatures in atomic swaps as a more reliable solution.REFERENCES:            “What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain      IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.‌‌      Wikipedia Contributors. “Blockchain.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.“What Are Atomic Swaps?,” Investopedia, 2021.

They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.”Understanding how crypto wallets work Blockchain is a public ledger that stores data in what’s known as “blocks.” These are records of all transactions, the balances held at any given address, and who holds the key to those balances. Crypto isn’t stored “in” a wallet, per se. The coins exist on a blockchain and the wallet software allows you to interact with the balances held on that blockchain. The wallet itself stores addresses and allows their owners to move coins elsewhere while also letting others see the balance held at any given address.“Most Crypto wallets allow users to send, receive, and store crypto. Some have a feature to buy and spend cryptocurrencies,” says Utsav Dar, co-founder of Incub8 Finance. “Certain crypto wallets have additional features like swapping between tokens, staking tokens for a fixed return paid out to users, as well as access to dApps (decentralized applications) built on various networks.”While each wallet has its own specific nuances, here are the general steps involved in sending or receiving funds using a crypto wallet:      To receive funds, you need to retrieve an address (also known as a public key) from your wallet. Locate the “generate address” feature in your wallet, click it, then copy the alphanumeric address or QR code and share it with the person who wants to send you crypto.        To send funds, you need the address of the receiving wallet. Locate the “send” feature in your wallet and enter an address of the wallet you intend to send coins to. Select the amount of crypto you’d like to send, and click “confirm.” Consider sending a small test transaction before sending large amounts of crypto. Note that sending coins requires a fee that will be paid to miners in exchange for processing the transaction.  Sending money via QR codes or long strings of numbers and letters may seem strange at first. But after doing it a few times, the process becomes quite simple.How do you use a crypto wallet?Crypto wallets range from simple-to-use apps to more complex security solutions. The main types of wallets you can choose from include:Paper wallets: Keys are written on a physical medium like paper and stored in a safe place. This of course makes using your crypto harder, because as digital money it can only be used on the internet.Hardware wallets: Keys are stored in a thumb-drive device that is kept in a safe place and only connected to a computer when you want to use your crypto. The idea is to try to balance security and convenience.Online wallets: Keys are stored in an app or other software – look for one that is protected by two-step encryption. This makes sending, receiving, and using your crypto as easy as using any online bank account, payment system, or brokerage.Each type has its tradeoffs. Paper and hardware wallets are harder for malicious users to access because they are stored offline, but they are limited in function and risk being lost or destroyed. Online wallets offered by a major exchange like Coinbase are the simplest way to get started in crypto and offer a balance of security and easy access. (Because your private info is online, your protection against hackers is only as good as your wallet provider’s security – so make sure you look for features like two-factor verification.)What could be done with the help of Crypto Wallets  Manage all your digital assets in one secure place  Control your own private keys  Send and receive cryptocurrency to and from anywhere in the world  Interact with usernames rather than long, hexadecimal “public key” addresses  Browse dapps (decentralized finance apps)  Shop at stores that accept cryptocurrencyREFERENCES:      “What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.‌        Wikipedia Contributors. “Blockchain.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.        “What Is a Crypto Wallet?” @Coinbase, Coinbase, 2021, www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-crypto-wallet.

            "summary": null,
            "content_text": "What exactly is Blockchain mining?A peer-to-peer computer process, Blockchain mining is used to secure and verify Cryptocurrency transactions. Mining involves Blockchain miners who add cryptocurrencies transaction data to cryptocurrency’s global public ledger of past transactions. In the ledgers, blocks are secured by Blockchain miners and are connected forming a chain.When we talk in-depth, as opposed to traditional financial services systems, Bitcoins have no central clearinghouse. Bitcoin transactions are generally verified in decentralized clearing systems wherein people contribute computing resources to verify the same. This process of verifying transactions is called mining. It is probably referred to as mining as it is analogous to mining of commodities like gold—mining gold requires a lot of effort and resources, but then there is a limited supply of gold; hence, the amount of gold that is mined every year remains roughly the same. In the same manner, a lot of computing power is consumed in the process of mining bitcoins. The number of bitcoins that are generated from mining dwindles over time. In the words of Satoshi Nakamoto, there’s a limited supply of bitcoins—only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created.At its core, the term ‘Blockchain mining’ is used to describe the process of adding transaction records to the bitcoin blockchain. This process of adding blocks to the blockchain is how transactions are processed and how money moves around securely on Bitcoins. This process of Blockchain mining is performed by a community of people around the world called ‘Blockchain miners.’Anyone can apply to become a Blockchain miner. These Blockchain miners install and run a special Blockchain mining software that enables their computers to communicate securely with one another. Once a computer installs the software, joins the network and begins mining bitcoins, it becomes what is called a ‘node.’ Together, all these nodes communicate with one another and process transactions to add new blocks to the blockchain which is commonly known as the bitcoin network. This bitcoin network runs throughout the day. It processes equivalent to millions of dollars in bitcoin transactions and has never been hacked or experienced downtime since its launch in 2009.Types of MiningThere are mainly three disting types of mining refereed to cryptocurrencies1. Individual Mining When mining is done by an individual, user registration as a miner is necessary. As soon as a transaction takes place, a mathematical problem is given to all the single users in the blockchain network to solve. The first one to solve it gets rewarded.Once the solution is found, all the other miners in the blockchain network will validate the decrypted value and then add it to the blockchain. Thus, verifying the transaction.2. Pool Mining    In pool mining, a group of users works together to approve the transaction. Sometimes, the complexity of the data encrypted in the blocks makes it difficult for a user to decrypt the encoded data alone. So, a group of miners works as a team to solve it. After the validation of the result, the reward is then split between all users.3. Cloud Mining    Cloud mining eliminates the need for computer hardware and software. It’s a hassle-free method to extract blocks. With cloud mining, handling all the machinery, order timings, or selling profits is no longer a constant worry.While it is hassle-free, it has its own set of disadvantages. The operational functionality is limited with the limitations on bitcoin hashing. The operational expenses increase as the reward profits are low. Software upgrades are restricted and so is the verification process.Uses of Blockchain Mining1. Validating Transactions    Cryptocurrencies function without a central administrator and the insecurity can be substantial with the transactions that transpire. So, what is the authentication method with such cryptocurrencies? With each transaction, new blocks are added to the blockchain in the network and the validation lies in the mining results from the blockchain miners.2. Confirming Transactions    Miners work the blockchain mining process to confirm whether the transaction is authentic or not. All confirmed transactions are then included in the blockchain.3. Securing Networks    With more users mining the blockchain,  the blockchain network security increases. Network security ensures that there are no fraudulent activities happening with the cryptocurrencies.REFERENCES:“What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.Wikipedia Contributors. “Blockchain.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.Naveen. “What Is Blockchain Mining?” Intellipaat Blog, Intellipaat, 26 Aug. 2021, intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/blockchain-tutorial/what-is-bitcoin-mining/.            “Blockchain Explained: How Does a Transaction Get into the Blockchain?

            "content_html": "<p><b><span style=\"color:green\">What exactly is Blockchain mining?</span></b><br />A peer-to-peer computer process, <b><span style=\"color:green\">Blockchain mining is used to secure and verify Cryptocurrency transactions.</span></b> Mining involves Blockchain miners who add cryptocurrencies transaction data to cryptocurrency’s global public ledger of past transactions. In the ledgers, blocks are secured by Blockchain miners and are connected forming a chain.</p><p>When we talk in-depth, as opposed to traditional financial services systems, Bitcoins have no central clearinghouse. Bitcoin transactions are generally verified in <b><span style=\"color:green\">decentralized clearing systems wherein people contribute computing resources to verify the same.</span></b> This process of verifying transactions is called mining. It is probably referred to as mining as it is analogous to mining of commodities like gold—mining gold requires a lot of effort and resources, but then there is a limited supply of gold; hence, the amount of gold that is mined every year remains roughly the same. In the same manner, <b><span style=\"color:green\">a lot of computing power is consumed in the process of mining bitcoins.</span></b> The number of bitcoins that are generated from mining dwindles over time. In the words of Satoshi Nakamoto, there’s a limited supply of bitcoins—only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created.</p><p>At its core, the term ‘Blockchain mining’ is used to describe the process of adding transaction records to the bitcoin blockchain. This process of adding blocks to the blockchain is how transactions are processed and how money moves around securely on Bitcoins. This process of Blockchain mining is performed by a community of people around the world called ‘Blockchain miners.’</p><p>Anyone can apply to become a Blockchain miner. These Blockchain miners install and run a <b><span style=\"color:green\">special Blockchain mining software that enables their computers to communicate securely with one another.</span></b> Once a computer installs the software, joins the network and begins mining bitcoins, it becomes what is called a <em><a href=\"https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/01/what-is-nodes-in-blockchain\">‘node.’</a></em> Together, all these nodes communicate with one another and process transactions to add new blocks to the blockchain which is commonly known as the bitcoin network. This bitcoin network runs throughout the day. It processes equivalent to millions of dollars in bitcoin transactions and has never been hacked or experienced downtime since its launch in 2009.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">Types of Mining</span></b><br />There are mainly three disting types of mining refereed to cryptocurrencies<br /><br /><b><span style=\"color:green\">1. Individual Mining </span></b><br />When mining is done by an individual, user registration as a miner is necessary. As soon as a transaction takes place, a mathematical problem is given to all the single users in the blockchain network to solve. The first one to solve it gets rewarded.</p><p>Once the solution is found, all the other miners in the blockchain network will validate the decrypted value and then add it to the blockchain. Thus, verifying the transaction.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">2. Pool Mining</span></b><br />    In pool mining, a group of users works together to approve the transaction. Sometimes, the complexity of the data encrypted in the blocks makes it difficult for a user to decrypt the encoded data alone. So, a group of miners works as a team to solve it. After the validation of the result, the reward is then split between all users.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">3. Cloud Mining</span></b><br />    Cloud mining eliminates the need for computer hardware and software. It’s a hassle-free method to extract blocks. With cloud mining, handling all the machinery, order timings, or selling profits is no longer a constant worry.</p><p>While it is hassle-free, it has its own set of disadvantages. The operational functionality is limited with the limitations on bitcoin hashing. The operational expenses increase as the reward profits are low. Software upgrades are restricted and so is the verification process.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">Uses of Blockchain Mining</span></b><br /><br /><b><span style=\"color:green\">1. Validating Transactions</span></b><br />    Cryptocurrencies function without a central administrator and the insecurity can be substantial with the transactions that transpire. So, what is the authentication method with such cryptocurrencies? With each transaction, new blocks are added to the blockchain in the network and the validation lies in the mining results from the blockchain miners.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">2. Confirming Transactions</span></b><br />    Miners work the blockchain mining process to confirm whether the transaction is authentic or not. All confirmed transactions are then included in the blockchain.</p><p><b><span style=\"color:green\">3. Securing Networks</span></b><br />    With more users mining the blockchain,  the blockchain network security increases. Network security ensures that there are no fraudulent activities happening with the cryptocurrencies.</p><hr /><h4 id=\"references\">REFERENCES:</h4><p>“What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.</p><p>Wikipedia Contributors. “Blockchain.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.</p><p>Naveen. “What Is Blockchain Mining?” Intellipaat Blog, Intellipaat, 26 Aug. 2021, intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/blockchain-tutorial/what-is-bitcoin-mining/.</p><table>  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>“Blockchain Explained: How Does a Transaction Get into the Blockchain?</td>      <td>Euromoney Learning.” Euromoney.com, 2016, www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/how-transactions-get-into-the-blockchain.</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><p>Techopedia. “Mining.” Techopedia.com, Techopedia, 8 May 2017, www.techopedia.com/definition/32530/mining-blockchain.</p>",

As a result, if a miner tried to do this, he would lose all his mining work.On the other hand, in the whitepaper From Bitcoin, Nakamoto explains that another functionality of the timestamp is to create a mechanism to avoid double-spending. In this regard, Nakamoto wrote the following:      For our purposes, the last transaction is what counts, so we won’t mind other subsequent double-spending attempts.

It’s a fundamental part of the blockchain network, which is the decentralised ledger that is used to maintain a cryptocurrency.The explanation can vary depending on the protocol.

Based on the block’s legitimacy (validity of signature and transactions), nodes can accept or reject the block. When a node accepts a new block of transactions, it saves and stores it on top of the rest of the blocks it already has stored. In short, here is what nodes do:  Nodes check if a block of transactions is valid and accept or reject it.  Nodes save and store blocks of transactions (storing blockchain transaction history).  Nodes broadcast and spread this transaction history to other nodes that may need to synchronize with the blockchain (need to be updated on transaction history).What are the types of nodes?There are basically two types of nodes: full nodes and lightweight nodes.      Full nodes support and provide security to the network. These nodes download a blockchain’s entire history to observe and enforce its rules.        Each user in the network is a lightweight node. The lightweight node has to connect to a full node to be able to participate.  Many volunteers run full Bitcoin nodes in a bid to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of now, there are roughly 12,130 public nodes running on the Bitcoin network. Other than the public nodes, there are many hidden nodes (non-listening nodes). These nodes usually run behind a firewall.Miners’ nodesThere is also a third type of node: Miner nodes. The term “Bitcoin miners” has now become familiar. These miners are classified as nodes. the miner may work alone (solo miner) or in groups (pool miner). A solo miner uses his full node. In a mining pool, only the administrator can run a full node — which can be referred to as a pool miner’s full node.The difference between a miner and a nodeA miner always needs to run a full node to select valid transactions to form a new block. Without a full node, it cannot determine what proposed transactions are valid according to the current blockchain’s transaction history (aka if all balances involved in the transactions are sufficient enough to perform the proposed transactions) because it does not have access to the full blockchain history. Therefore, a miner is always also a full node. A node, however, is not necessarily simultaneously a miner. A device can run a full node by receiving, storing and broadcasting all transaction data (much like a server) without actually creating new blocks of transactions itself. In this case, it functions more like a passing point with a directory, whereas a miner is the same but simultaneously tries to create new blocks of transactions as well.Listening nodes (supernodes)And finally, a sub-category called listening nodes. A listening node, essentially, is a publicly visible full node. It communicates with any node that decides to establish a connection with it. A reliable super node typically runs all the time, transmitting blockchain history and transaction data to multiple nodes.REFERENCES:“What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.Wikipedia Contributors. “Blockchain.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.“What Is a Blockchain Node and How Is It Used in Cryptocurrency?” NDTV Gadgets 360, gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/features/what-is-a-blockchain-node-how-does-cryptocurrency-work-2515427.Jimi S. “Blockchain: What Are Nodes and Masternodes?” Medium, Coinmonks, 5 Sept. 2018, medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-what-is-a-node-or-masternode-and-what-does-it-do-4d9a4200938f.",

            "content_text": "Blockchain is the technology that allows the user to create a decentralized system of transaction and data transfers. For the naïve person, it is a method to create a people’s bank without central banks! Blockchain technology is used in the backend for each cryptocurrency. Talking about that, Blockchain is building the blocks of every critical data and then chaining the blocks. So if the last block or any previous block is changed or updated, then every information in the chain needs to be updated. This makes blockchain technology secure and more robust compared to other technologies.Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that felicitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An investment can be tangible (a house or a car) or intangible (Intellectual property, patents, or copyrights). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.Finally, Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks linked together with cryptography which is also described as “trustless and fully decentralized peer to peer immutable data storage which is spread over the network of participants often referred to as the nodes. Every block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block and the timestamp, and the transaction data.But first, let’s get back to basics. What is Blockchain, and how does it work?A blockchain is a file for storing data. Or, to put it in more technical terms, it’s an open, distributed database system. The data is distributed (i.e., duplicated), and the whole Blockchain is entirely decentralized. This means no one person or entity  (say, a government or corporation like Google or Microsoft) has control over the Blockchain;  this is a radical departure from the centralized (Government databases) databases controlled and administered by businesses and other entities.So how does it work? In straightforward terms, the file consists of blocks of data, with each block being connected to the previous block with the hashing code,  forming a chain. Hence, the name “blockchain.” As well as the data itself, each block also contains a record of when that block was created or edited. It contains the hash code of the previous block, which makes it very useful for maintaining a complex system of records that cannot be corrupted or lost, and this is the primary use case to preserve the integrity of the data.Because the whole Blockchain is duplicated across many computers,  any user can view the entire Blockchain in the case of public blockchains. Transactions or records are processed not by one central administrator but by a network of users who work to verify the data and achieve a consensus; these verifiers are known as miners, each miner is paid some cryptocurrency for successful mining. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Bitcoin operates in the same way. Bitcoin is the first example of Blockchain in action.REFERENCES:“What Is Blockchain Technology? - IBM Blockchain IBM.” Ibm.com, 2021, www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.‌Wikipedia Contributors. “Blockchain.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 16 Oct. 2021, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain.",
            "content_html": "<p>Blockchain is the technology that allows the user to <b><span style=\"color:green\">create a decentralized system of transaction and data transfers</span></b>. For the naïve person, it is a method to create a people’s bank without central banks! Blockchain technology is used in the backend for each cryptocurrency. Talking about that, Blockchain is building the blocks of every critical data and then chaining the blocks. So if the last block or any previous block is changed or updated, then every information in the chain needs to be updated. This makes blockchain technology secure and more robust compared to other technologies.</p><p>Blockchain is a <b><span style=\"color:green\">shared, immutable ledger that felicitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network</span></b>. An investment can be tangible (a house or a car) or intangible (Intellectual property, patents, or copyrights). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.</p><p>Finally, Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks linked together with cryptography which is also described as “trustless and fully decentralized peer to peer immutable data storage which is spread over the network of participants often referred to as the nodes. Every block contains a <b><span style=\"color:green\">cryptographic hash of the previous block and the timestamp</span></b>, and the transaction data.</p><p>But first, let’s get back to basics.
