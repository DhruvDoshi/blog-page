This means the  individual holds power over the resource they want to verify on the  blockchain. This could be in cryptos, certificate authentication, land  titles, etc. The problem with this is if a transaction goes sour after  it has already been verified on the blockchain, the only feasible way of  returning the transaction is if the parties agree to reverse it. Using a  centralized system like a bank. However, there is a procedure in place  to be able to dispute trades after they are complete.Some  trade technologies that settle on a blockchain have used an arbiter  system to fix this problem, an example of this is the Open Bazaar P2P  trade network. This way a trade occurs between two people, and one  impartial moderator.2. Settlement on a blockchain is slow A  cost of settling a transaction on the blockchain is that all the nodes  in the network need to come to an agreement that the transaction is  valid. This is a far slower process than having a bank verify your  transaction in an instant.Transactions  can be made instantaneously, however until the block in which the  transaction is inserted in has been verified, it is classified is  untrustworthy. In the time between a lodged transaction is made and when  the block settles, a bad actor could launch fraudulent transactions to  trick the network into what is known as double spend.A  very exciting upcoming technology that could solve this problem is the  lightning network. This solution acts as a layer 2 of blockchain  technology; it can be applied to any public blockchain. It will enable  instantly verified transactions for a fraction of the cost of today’s  settlement.3. Miners can be selfishThe  mining process on the blockchain is an innovation which uses game  theory economics to incentivise people to commit computer power for  securing the network for a profit. The down-side of this is generally  miners won’t care about settling as many transactions as possible; they  will make the most money by finding and verifying a block in the fastest  way possible.This  leads to a problem of miners finding empty blocks and validating. There  is also another problem known as Selfish Mining, which is a situation  where a miner or mining pool finds and validates a block and does not  publish and distribute a valid solution to the rest of the network.4. The growing blockchain size With  every new block, a blockchain grows. This can be an issue because each  node that is validating the network needs to store the entire history of  the blockchain in order to be a participant. This is a hard enough  problem with the bitcoin blockchain where the transaction size is only a  few bytes, the total blockchain size as of January 2017 is 98GB. Given  that at the same time in 2016 the size was 50GB, and the use of the  blockchain is continuing to increase, this is a growing concern.One  of the biggest debates in the bitcoin space is if the block size should  be increased. If a blockchain has bigger blocks the blockchain size  will increase faster, thus weeding out the solo miners eventually. This  is a big issue because the health of a blockchain network is partially  dependent on the amount of nodes in the network, and the spread of those  nodes across the world. The counter argument for this issue is that  with sufficient advancement of technology hard disk space will be very  cheap in the future and will stay ahead of the blockchain size. The  debate is ongoing.5. Eventually settlement on the blockchain will not be cheap On  any public blockchain, space in a block is a finite resource.  Necessarily as the network is utilized more the amount of transactions  that will want to settle in a block will exceed the storage capacity.  Public blockchain networks have a solution built in for this which is  that transactions with a higher miner fee attached will get precedence  to be included in a block. This makes sense because the miners want to  maximize their profit so that they will include transactions with the  highest fees first.This  is not a bug, but a feature. If it were free to settle on the  blockchain, there would be far too many ways of attacking the blocks  with dust transactions and clogging up the network. Originally the  bitcoin blockchain had no block size limit; this was eventually set to  1MB to avoid a Sybil Attack on the network.All  of these problems have potential solutions that can be implemented as a  fix. In my view blockchains will eventually have layers of  centralisation like the lightning network. However, this is not a bad  thing so long as there is a sufficient amount of encryption to protect  the privacy of the people who want to use the centralized layers of the  network.REFERENCES“5 Weak Points Of Blockchain Technology,” Blockgeeks, 13-Jan-2017.

It contains the hash code of the previous block, which makes it very useful for maintaining a complex system of records that cannot be corrupted or lost, and this is the primary use case to preserve the integrity of the data. Because the whole Blockchain is duplicated across many computers,  any user can view the entire Blockchain in the case of public blockchains.
