title: Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) - Cloud Computing
description: Infrastructure as a service is a cloud service model which is widely used in today's age and time.
summary: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements.

<b><span style="color:green">Advantages of IAAS</span></b><br>
Taken in consideration there are many points which makes this model best for the cloud computing. Those are listed below.

1. Pay As You Go
2. Speed 
3. Avaliablity
4. Scale
5. Latency and Performance

As listed, IAAS is better in all the terms compared to all other traditional models and all comparative models like PAAS and SAAS.
