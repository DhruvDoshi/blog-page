title: What are Crypto wallets in Blockchan and Cryptocurrencies ?
description: A crypto wallet is a software program or physical device that allows you to store your crypto and allow for the sending and receiving of crypto transactions. A crypto wallet consists of two key pairs private keys and public keys. A public key is derived from the private key and serves as the address used to send crypto to the wallet.
summary: Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet, which makes using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online.

Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet, which makes using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online.

Going in depth we could signify the defination for the crypto wallets like, <span style="color:green">*"Crypto wallets store your private keys, keeping your crypto safe and accessible. They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum."*</span>

<b><span style="color:green">Understanding how crypto wallets work </span></b><br>
Blockchain is a public ledger that stores data in what's known as "blocks." These are records of all transactions, the balances held at any given address, and who holds the key to those balances. Crypto isn't stored "in" a wallet, per se. The coins exist on a blockchain and the wallet software allows you to interact with the balances held on that blockchain. The wallet itself stores addresses and allows their owners to move coins elsewhere while also letting others see the balance held at any given address.

*"Most Crypto wallets allow users to send, receive, and store crypto. Some have a feature to buy and spend cryptocurrencies,"* says Utsav Dar, co-founder of Incub8 Finance. *"Certain crypto wallets have additional features like swapping between tokens, staking tokens for a fixed return paid out to users, as well as access to dApps (decentralized applications) built on various networks."*

While each wallet has its own specific nuances, here are the general steps involved in sending or receiving funds using a crypto wallet:

 - <b><span style="color:green">To receive funds,</span></b> you need to retrieve an address (also known as a public key) from your wallet. Locate the "generate address" feature in your wallet, click it, then copy the alphanumeric address or QR code and share it with the person who wants to send you crypto.

 - <b><span style="color:green">To send funds,</span></b> you need the address of the receiving wallet. Locate the "send" feature in your wallet and enter an address of the wallet you intend to send coins to. Select the amount of crypto you'd like to send, and click "confirm." Consider sending a small test transaction before sending large amounts of crypto. Note that sending coins requires a fee that will be paid to miners in exchange for processing the transaction.

Sending money via QR codes or long strings of numbers and letters may seem strange at first. But after doing it a few times, the process becomes quite simple.


<b><span style="color:green">How do you use a crypto wallet?</span></b><br>
Crypto wallets range from simple-to-use apps to more complex security solutions. The main types of wallets you can choose from include:

<b><span style="color:green">Paper wallets:</span></b> Keys are written on a physical medium like paper and stored in a safe place. This of course makes using your crypto harder, because as digital money it can only be used on the internet.   

<b><span style="color:green">Hardware wallets:</span></b> Keys are stored in a thumb-drive device that is kept in a safe place and only connected to a computer when you want to use your crypto. The idea is to try to balance security and convenience.

<b><span style="color:green">Online wallets:</span></b> Keys are stored in an app or other software – look for one that is protected by two-step encryption. This makes sending, receiving, and using your crypto as easy as using any online bank account, payment system, or brokerage.   

Each type has its tradeoffs. Paper and hardware wallets are harder for malicious users to access because they are stored offline, but they are limited in function and risk being lost or destroyed. Online wallets offered by a major exchange like Coinbase are the simplest way to get started in crypto and offer a balance of security and easy access. (Because your private info is online, your protection against hackers is only as good as your wallet provider's security – so make sure you look for features like two-factor verification.)

<b><span style="color:green">What could be done with the help of Crypto Wallets</span></b><br>

1. Manage all your digital assets in one secure place 
2. Control your own private keys 
3. Send and receive cryptocurrency to and from anywhere in the world 
4. Interact with usernames rather than long, hexadecimal “public key” addresses 
5. Browse dapps (decentralized finance apps) 
6. Shop at stores that accept cryptocurrency
