Blockchain is the technology which allows the user to create the decentralized system of transaction and data transfers. Saying more on, for the naïve person it is a method to create a people’s bank without centrals banks! Blockchain technology is used in backend for each cryptocurrency. Talking about that, Blockchain is creating the blocks of every significant data and then chaining the blocks. So if the last block or any previous block is changed or updated then every information in the chain need to be updated. This makes blockchain technology secure and more robust compared to other technologies.

Blockchain is shared, immutable ledger that felicitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in business network. An asset can be tangible (a house or a car) or intangible (Intellectual property, patents or copyrights). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

Finally, Blockchain is growing list of records, called blocks that are linked together with cryptography which is also described as “trustless and fully decentralized peer to peer immutable data storage which is spread over the network of participants often referred to as the nodes. Every block contains cryptographic hash of previous block and the timestamp and the transaction data in it.
