title: Poly Cloud - Cloud Computing
description: This blogs emphasis on the poly cloud and comapres it with all other iterations
summary: Poly Cloud is often mistaken for multi-cloud. However there are key differences, and we find Poly Cloud to be a very interesting opportunity for business. In Poly Cloud approach you run specific parts of your workloads on the best provider for that specific function. For example you might be running your API on Lambda, but your data lake on Google.

<b><span style="color:green">POLY CLOUD</span></b><br>

A poly cloud is a cloud approach that uses different types of cloud services that are hosted onto various clouds. A poly cloud approach runs different kinds of cloud services on one cloud and hosting others on another cloud. Although they sound similar, there is a principal difference between multicloud and poly cloud.

The main difference between multicloud and poly cloud and is in the way a business organizes its cloud services within its general cloud strategy. Multicloud is using multiple clouds at the same time, but not choosing various clouds for a specific type of service. For instance, a business that uses a poly cloud strategy will have all of its data on one cloud service, and all of its virtual machines on another cloud service.

A poly cloud strategy is beneficial because businesses will use certain cloud services depending on specific features that can benefit their operation. Some cloud services might not have what you need, but another cloud service may. A poly cloud strategy is more intentional about the way it chooses a specific service.

Poly cloud makes businesses gives businesses a concrete and thoughtful strategy in the way they choose certain services and providers. Combining multiple clouds is one thing, but purposefully choosing for a specific reason will be more advantageous for its users.


<span style="color:green">Advantages of POLY CLOUD </span><br>

Hybrid clouds used to be the result of literally connecting a private cloud envrionment to a public cloud environment using massive, complex iterations of middleware. You could build that private cloud on your own, or you could use prepackaged cloud infrastructure like OpenStack®. You would also need a public cloud, like one of the few listed below:

 - You are mix and match parts of your solution based on best offering from vendors
 - You get performance and costs benefits
 - You are leveraging the most advanced offerings to provide the best value


<span style="color:green">Issues with POLY CLOUD?</span><br>

 - You are relying on the cloud-to-cloud vendor connectivity, where there might be increased latency
 - You are relying on different vendors availability; outage on one vendor can cause other parts of the application to stop performing.
 - Increased complexity due to the need to manage and deploy to different vendors
 - You are not able to leverage your spend to achieve a higher level of savings
 - A need to review and revise approach as offerings get updated and might need re-assessment

<span style="color:green">Security of POLY CLOUD?</span><br>
For the security aspects we could indulge it inside the multi cloud, basically the approach is same just with the difference with the expected outcome hence hte security concerns with the poly cloud would remain same as the multi cloud

Multi-cloud security has the specific challenge of protecting data in a consistent way across a variety of cloud providers. When a company uses a multi-cloud approach, third-party partners handle different aspects of security. That is why it is important in cloud deployment to clearly define and distribute security responsibilities among the parties.


Some organizations take advantage of multi-cloud capabilities to manage very large amounts of storage that is frequently accessed by a broad variety of users. For example, streaming media behemoth Netflix leverages both AWS and Google Cloud to reduce its dependency on a single provider, to take advantage of disaster recovery and business continuity services between providers, and to leverage those capabilities unique to each cloud.
