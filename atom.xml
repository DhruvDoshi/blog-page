   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;CLOUD COMPUTING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence[clarification needed] and economies of scale, typically using a “pay-as-you-go” model which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Service Models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are five service models out of them top 3 are widely used and most of the content ofinternet uses these kind of service models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog//2021/02/01/infrastructure-as-a-service&quot;&gt;Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/01/what-is-nodes-in-blockchain&quot;&gt;Platform as a Service (PaaS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/02/software-as-a-service&quot;&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/04/mobile-backend-as-a-service&quot;&gt;Mobile backend as a Service (MBaaS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/05/serverless-computing-as-a-service&quot;&gt;Serverless computing or Function as a Service (FaaS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Control comparison between all major models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following image we have the comparison between the different service models which gives us the insight about the  amount of access and the control we have while using this service models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XZiRPz8.png&quot; style=&quot;height:40%; width:80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Major Deployment Models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To deply the cloud architecture there are three ways we could do. With private being the most used till today organizations are moving to use Hybrid cloud more nowadyas and also migrating towards also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following images displays that what each cloud models offer to the users,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cDeVyAA.png&quot; style=&quot;height:40%; width:80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The following image puts more emphasis on the comparison across all three cloud models/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Security and Privacy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information. Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users’ choices for how data is stored. Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access. Identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing. These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity. The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are Insecure Interfaces and APIs, Data Loss &amp;amp; Leakage, and Hardware Failure—which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users, there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on the same data server. Additionally, Eugene Schultz, chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. “There are some real Achilles’ heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into”. Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack—a process he called “hyperjacking”. Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak. Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership. Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off-site and under someone else’s control (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services. Some small businesses that don’t have expertise in IT security could find that it’s more secure for them to use a public cloud. There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes don’t read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click “Accept” without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work, for example for an intelligent personal assistant (Apple’s Siri or Google Now). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To resolve these king of security and privacy concerns we could come up with the cloud service which could be clubbed up with &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/10/31/what-if-we-combine-blockchain-and-cloud&quot;&gt;Blockchain Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Limitations and Disadvanatages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are immense potential in cloud computing and features which could be extracted and which makes the developer life easy and easy to extend the resources power with minimal investment.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Downtime with Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/16/downtime-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/16/Downtime-in-cloud-computing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Downtine in Cloud Computing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cloud Outage simply refers to the duration when the cloud infrastructure service is unavailable for use. The unavailability may also refer to performance inadequacy of the service, as per the agreed SLA metrics. For instance, the incident during which an outage may have only partially impacted a data center may cause the vendor to perform the necessary maintenance and restoration measures. Until the service is fully restored as per the agreed SLA standards, it may be seen as a downtime for the end-user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Causes of Downtime or Cloud Outage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power Outage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyber Attacks and Security Breaches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human Errors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software and Technical Issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Networking Issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more desriptive attacks we could look at,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traffic Overload DDoS Attacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNS Failure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expired Domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Repurcations of Downtime or Cloud Outage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lost of Sales Revenue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lost employee Productivity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corruption of and gaps in mission-critical data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Damages to equipment and associated assets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cost of remediating systems and core business processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Damaged reputation with customers and key stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Degradation of employee morale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regulatory, compliance, and legal penalties (including potential litigation fees)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loss of insurance discounts; Contract penalties&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disruption of supply-chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reports, In 2013, Forbes famously calculated the cost associated with the eTailer’s most critical outage that year. Based on Amazon’s 2012 net sales, it was determined that  outage cost Amazon $66,240 per minute—or nearly $2 million. A previous outage in June 2008 was close to $31,000 per minute, based on the previous quarter’s global revenue of $4.13 billion. Amazon reported revenues of $107 billion in 2015, which comes out to $203,577 every minute in today’s numbers, or a $2,646,501 price tag for the 13 minute episode of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Last five major Cloud Outages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure, March 2020
 On March 3, 2020, Microsoft Azure services in Microsoft’s East U.S. data center region encountered more than six hours of outage. The outage affected a subset of East U.S. customers. The Redmond giant disclosed that a cooling system failure led to the outage, which impacted storage, compute, networking, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IBM Cloud, June 2020
 IBM Cloud suffered a multi-zone, four-hour interruption of services on June 10, 2020 that affected IBM cloud customers in Washington, D.C., Dallas, London, Frankfurt, and Sydney. The outage impacted general cloud services, Kubernetes services, App connect, and Watson AI cloud services. An investigation revealed that a third party network provider flooded the IBM Cloud network with incorrect routing, which impacted IBM Cloud services and 80+ data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare, July 2020
 A 27 minutes Cloudflare outage took down a significant chunk of internet services on July 17, 2020. The outage was due to a configuration error in Cloudflare’s global backbone network, which resulted in a 50% traffic drop across its network. The disruption impacted several big name clients such as Discord, Feedly, GitLab, League of Legends, Patreon, Politico, and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS, November 2020
 Even though 2020 turned out to be a strong financial year for AWS, the cloud giant suffered a multi-hour, global outage on November 25, 2020 which sparked a wave of memes on Twitter. The interruption affected the U.S. East-1 region that knocked down services of prominent AWS customers, including 1Password, Adobe Spark, Autodesk, Flickr, iRobot, Roku, Twilio, The Washington Post, and Glassdoor. The interruption was triggered due to the small addition of capacity to Amazon Kinesis. Also, it affected other AWS services, such as Lambda, LEX, Macie, Managed Blockchain, Marketplace, MediaLive, MediaConvert, Personalize, Rekognition, SageMaker, and Workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google Cloud, December 2020
 On December 14, 2020, Google Cloud experienced a widespread outage that interrupted services, including YouTube, Google Workspace, and Gmail. The 47 minutes outage was due to its automated storage quota management system that reduced the authentication system’s capacity and prevented users from accessing the services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>HPC Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/14/hpc-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/14/HPC-cloud-in-cloud-computing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;HPC CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HPC stands for High Performance Computing, the name dictattes itslef. This is the vertical in which cloud computing offers extremenly high resources in the computation side. AWS is run away winner with this use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new concept altogether. Here the difference between the traditional cloud service and this one is the ammount of resources and the speed which is being offered by the playform. As an Exaple AWS states, “Run your large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads in the cloud with a complete suite of high performance computing (HPC) products and services on AWS. Gain insights faster, and quickly move from idea to market with virtually unlimited compute capacity, a high-performance file system, and high-throughput networking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we need to define HPC it would be like, “High performance computing (HPC) is the ability to process data and perform complex calculations at high speeds. To put it into perspective, a laptop or desktop with a 3 GHz processor can perform around 3 billion calculations per second. While that is much faster than any human can achieve, it pales in comparison to HPC solutions that can perform quadrillions of calculations per second. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Use cases of HPC CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployed on premises, at the edge, or in the cloud, HPC solutions are used for a variety of purposes across multiple industries. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research Labs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Media and Entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oil and Gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Financial Services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Healthcare&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Who is offering HPC Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS)&lt;/a&gt; : The most prolific service provider in the market as it comees up with services like, EC2, ELASTIC FIBER, PARALLEL CLUSTER, AWS BATCH and NICE DCV.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/cloud&quot;&gt;IBM Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large scale istitutions like, Netflix, Amazon, MIT, HSBC, Mchigen University etc are using this service on daily basis to improve and obtain extreme computation edge compared to other peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of HPC CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bursting HPC workload into the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capacity and Capability to run HPC workloads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adapt the hardware resources to the individual HPC job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing and benchmarking new hardware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save money and time on expensive ISV software licenses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Archive result data&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Poly Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/12/poly-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/12/Poly-cloud-in-cloud-computing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;POLY CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poly cloud is a cloud approach that uses different types of cloud services that are hosted onto various clouds. A poly cloud approach runs different kinds of cloud services on one cloud and hosting others on another cloud. Although they sound similar, there is a principal difference between multicloud and poly cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between multicloud and poly cloud and is in the way a business organizes its cloud services within its general cloud strategy. Multicloud is using multiple clouds at the same time, but not choosing various clouds for a specific type of service. For instance, a business that uses a poly cloud strategy will have all of its data on one cloud service, and all of its virtual machines on another cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poly cloud strategy is beneficial because businesses will use certain cloud services depending on specific features that can benefit their operation. Some cloud services might not have what you need, but another cloud service may. A poly cloud strategy is more intentional about the way it chooses a specific service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poly cloud makes businesses gives businesses a concrete and thoughtful strategy in the way they choose certain services and providers. Combining multiple clouds is one thing, but purposefully choosing for a specific reason will be more advantageous for its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of POLY CLOUD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid clouds used to be the result of literally connecting a private cloud envrionment to a public cloud environment using massive, complex iterations of middleware. You could build that private cloud on your own, or you could use prepackaged cloud infrastructure like OpenStack®. You would also need a public cloud, like one of the few listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are mix and match parts of your solution based on best offering from vendors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You get performance and costs benefits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are leveraging the most advanced offerings to provide the best value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Issues with POLY CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are relying on the cloud-to-cloud vendor connectivity, where there might be increased latency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are relying on different vendors availability; outage on one vendor can cause other parts of the application to stop performing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased complexity due to the need to manage and deploy to different vendors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are not able to leverage your spend to achieve a higher level of savings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A need to review and revise approach as offerings get updated and might need re-assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Security of POLY CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the security aspects we could indulge it inside the multi cloud, basically the approach is same just with the difference with the expected outcome hence hte security concerns with the poly cloud would remain same as the multi cloud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-cloud security has the specific challenge of protecting data in a consistent way across a variety of cloud providers. When a company uses a multi-cloud approach, third-party partners handle different aspects of security. That is why it is important in cloud deployment to clearly define and distribute security responsibilities among the parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some organizations take advantage of multi-cloud capabilities to manage very large amounts of storage that is frequently accessed by a broad variety of users. For example, streaming media behemoth Netflix leverages both AWS and Google Cloud to reduce its dependency on a single provider, to take advantage of disaster recovery and business continuity services between providers, and to leverage those capabilities unique to each cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Multi Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/11/multi-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;MULTI CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-cloud is the use of two or more cloud computing services from any number of different cloud vendors. A multi-cloud environment could be all-private, all-public or a combination of both. Companies use multi-cloud environments to distribute computing resources and minimize the risk of downtime and data loss. They can also increase the computing power and storage available to a business. Innovations in the cloud in recent years have resulted in a move from single-user private clouds to multi-tenant public clouds and hybrid clouds — a heterogeneous environment that leverages different infrastructure environments like the private and public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How does MULTI CLOUD look like!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sNscupF.png&quot; style=&quot;height:40%; width:80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the image, there would be multiple instances of cloud which would would be supplying for the resources and the computation power need to opercome the requirenemnt. Moreover because of the multiple clouds it works as the subset of distributed cloud as there are multiple cloud instances in distributed cloud but alongwith that they are also distributed in the geographic location also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of MULTI CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Although Multi cloud is advanced version and mixture of hybrid cloud and distributed cloud, there are all the advantages covered of both alongside that there are many more which are listed belop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reliablity and Redundancy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduced Vender Lock In&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potential cost saving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Distributed Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/10/distributed-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/10/Distributed-cloud-in-cloud-computing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;DISTRIBUTED CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Distributed cloud enables a geographically distributed, centrally managed distribution of public cloud services optimized for performance, compliance, and edge computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How distributed cloud WORKS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You may have heard of distributed computing, in which application components are spread across different networked computers, and communicate with one another through messaging or APIs, with the goal of improving overall application performance or maximize computing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed cloud goes a giant step further by distributing a public cloud provider’s entire compute stack to wherever a customer might need it - on-premises in the customer’s own data center or private cloud, or off-premises in one or more public cloud data centers that may or may not belong to the cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, distributed cloud extends the provider’s centralized cloud with geographically distributed micro-cloud satellites. The cloud provider retains central control over the operations, updates, governance, security and reliability of all distributed infrastructure. And the customer accesses everything - the centralized cloud services, and the satellites wherever they are located - as a single cloud and manages it all from a single control plane. In this way, as industry analyst Gartner puts it, distributed cloud fixes with hybrid cloud and hybrid multicloud breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Use Case for DISTRIBUTED CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Distributed cloud and edge computing support everything from simplified multicloud management, to improved scalability and development velocity, to deployment of state-of-the-art automation and decision support applications and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved hybrid cloud/multicloud visibility and manageability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Efficient, cost-effective scalability and agility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easier industry or localized regulatory compliance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Faster content delivery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IoT, (AI) and machine learning applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scalablity and Flexiablity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Challenges with DISTRIBUTED CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Managing an enterprise using a multi-site cloud deployment has its challenges including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;FURTHER READING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of distributed cloud could be merged with multiple new age technologies like, blockchian and AI. There is a post on this please &lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/10/31/what-if-we-combine-blockchain-and-cloud&quot;&gt; read this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Community Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/09/community-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/09/Community-cloud-in-cloud-computing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;COMMUNITY CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Community cloud computing refers to a shared cloud computing service environment that is targeted to a limited set of organizations or employees (such as banks or heads of trading firms). The organizing principle for the community will vary, but the members of the community generally share similar security, privacy, performance and compliance requirements. Community members may wish to invoke a mechanism that is often run by themselves (not just the provider) to review those seeking entry into the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of a community cloud is more complicated than other types of clouds. This is because of the number of players involved. Decisions are no longer standalone, and, as a result, a handbook needs to be established at the outset, which must cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mission statements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ownership of services and resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An economic model of shared cloud and services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource allocation and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Industry regulations binding each organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the startup costs and inevitable teething problems, as per industry estimates, the community cloud market is estimated to reach $12.8 billion by 2027 from $2.6 billion in 2020. This is because the benefits of a community cloud currently outweigh the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Architecture for COMMUNITY CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the below image the architecture of community cloud is explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/M3fU55v.png&quot; style=&quot;height:40%; width:80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages for COMMUNITY CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cost Effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regulatory Compliance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Industry based security compliance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High Avaliablity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Best practices for COMMUNITY CLOUD implementations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To implement the community cloud major things should be taken in the consideration which are further explained in the image and listed below also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w5r9maj.png&quot; style=&quot;height:40%; width:80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluate and narrow down on the cloud management system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Document the terms of shared ownership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine procurement and cost management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Address security requirements and patch management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide on a data segmentation plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure change management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Factor in scalability and migration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan backup and disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a community cloud involves more focus on business processes and cooperation than technical considerations. After all, a community cloud is just a modified private cloud. A community cloud can be a powerful tool for businesses with the same objectives and requirements. It can even serve as a background for industry-based innovations. When deciding on infrastructure migration to the cloud, private and public clouds are not the only options; community clouds can also fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hybrid Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/08/hybrid-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;HYBRID CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid cloud refers to a mixed computing, storage, and services environment made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and a public cloud—such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure—with orchestration among the various platforms. Using a combination of public clouds, on-premises computing, and private clouds in your data center means that you have a hybrid cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid cloud is an IT architecture that incorporates some degree of workload portability, orchestration, and management across 2 or more environments. Depending on whom you ask, those environments may need to include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least 1 private cloud and at least 1 public cloud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 or more private clouds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 or more public clouds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bare-metal or virtual environment connected to at least 1 cloud—public or private&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These varying requirements are an evolution from the earlier age of cloud computing, where the differences between public clouds and private clouds were easily defined by location and ownership. But today’s cloud types are far more complex, because location and ownership are abstract considerations. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public clouds traditionally ran off-premises, but public cloud providers are now running cloud services on their clients’ on-premise data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private clouds traditionally ran on-premises, but organizations are now building private clouds on rented, vendor-owned data centers located off-premises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it can be more helpful to define hybrid cloud computing by what it does. All hybrid clouds should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect multiple computers through a network.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consolidate IT resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scale out and quickly provision new resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be able to move workloads between environments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incorporate a single, unified management tool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orchestrate processes with the help of automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How to build HYBRID CLOUD ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid clouds used to be the result of literally connecting a private cloud envrionment to a public cloud environment using massive, complex iterations of middleware. You could build that private cloud on your own, or you could use prepackaged cloud infrastructure like OpenStack®. You would also need a public cloud, like one of the few listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.alibabacloud.com/en&quot;&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/cloud&quot;&gt;IBM Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you would need to link the public cloud to the private cloud. Moving huge amounts of resources among these environments require powerful middleware, or a preconfigured VPN that many cloud service providers give customers as part of their subscription packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/concepts/dedicated-overview&quot;&gt;Google Cloud offers Dedicated Interconnect.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers Direct Connect.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/expressroute/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure offers ExpressRoute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstack.org/passport/&quot;&gt;OpenStack provides the OpenStack Public Cloud Passport.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of HYBRID CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Although cloud services can drive cost savings, their main value lies in supporting a fast-moving digital business transformation. Every technology management organization runs under two agendas: the IT agenda and the business transformation agenda. Typically, the IT agenda has been focused on saving money. However, digital business transformation agendas are focused on investments to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of a hybrid cloud is agility. The need to adapt and change direction quickly is a core principle of a digital business. Your enterprise might want (or need) to combine public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises resources to gain the agility it needs for a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which definition of hybrid cloud that you use, the benefits are the same: When computing and processing demand increases beyond an on-premises data centre’s capabilities, businesses can use the cloud to instantly scale capacity up or down to handle excess capacity. It also allows them to avoid the time and cost of purchasing, installing and maintaining new servers that they may not always need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Security of HYBRID CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A properly designed, integrated, and managed hybrid cloud can be as secure as traditional on-premise IT infrastructure. While there are some unique hybrid cloud security challenges (like data migration, increased complexity, and a larger attack surface), the presence of multiple environments can be one of the strongest defenses against security risks. All those interconnected environments let enterprises choose where to place sensitive data based on requirements, and it lets security teams standardize redundant cloud storage that can augment disaster recovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Private Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/07/private-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/07/Private-cloud-in-cloud-computing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;PRIVATE CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private cloud is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single customer. It combines many of the benefits of cloud computing with the security and control of on-premises IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How PRIVATE CLOUD works?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private cloud is a single-tenant environment, meaning all resources are accessible to one customer only—this is referred to as isolated access. Private clouds are typically hosted on-premises in the customer’s data center. But, private clouds can also be hosted on an independent cloud provider’s infrastructure or built on rented infrastructure housed in an offsite data center. Management models also vary—the customer can manage everything itself or outsource partial or full management to a service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How PRIVATE CLOUD architecture looks like?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single-tenant design aside, private cloud is based on the same technologies as other clouds—technologies that enable the customer to provision and configure virtual servers and computing resources on demand in order to quickly and easily (or even automatically) scale in response to spikes in usage and traffic, to implement redundancy for high availability, and to optimize utilization of resources overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Virtualization&lt;/b&gt;, which enables IT resources to be abstracted from their underlying physical hardware and pooled into unbounded resource pools of computing, storage, memory, and networking capacity that can then portioned among multiple virtual machines (VMs), containers, or other virtualized IT infrastructure elements. By removing the constraints of physical hardware, virtualization enables maximum utilization of hardware, allows hardware to be shared efficiently across multiple users and applications, and makes possible the scalability, agility, and elasticity of the cloud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management software&amp;lt;/b.&amp;gt; gives administrators centralized control over the infrastructure and applications running on it. This makes it possible to optimize security, availability, and resource utilization in the private cloud environment.&lt;br.&gt;&lt;/br.&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automation speeds&lt;/b&gt; tasks—such as server provisioning and integrations—that would otherwise need to be performed manually and repeatedly. Automation reduces the need for human intervention, making self-service resource delivery possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, private cloud users can adopt cloud native application architectures and practices—such as DevOps, containers, and microservices—that can bring even greater efficiency and flexibility and enable a smooth transition to a public cloud or hybrid cloud environment in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of PRIVATE CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full control over hardware and software choices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freedom to customize hardware and software in any way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greater visibility into security and access control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully enforced compliance with regulatory standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Efficient resource allocation based on user needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Public Cloud - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/06/public-cloud-in-cloud-computing"/>
   <updated>2021-02-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/06/Public-cloud-in-cloud-computing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;PUBLIC CLOUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a third-party service provider makes computing resources—which can include anything from ready-to-use software applications, to individual virtual machines (VMs), to complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development platforms—available to users over the public Internet. These resources might be accessible for free, or access might be sold according to subscription-based or pay-per-usage pricing models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How PUBLIC CLOUD works?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A public cloud relies on a virtualized environment to provide an extension of a company’s IT infrastructure, allowing that company to host certain aspects of its infrastructure and services on virtual servers that are offsite and owned by a third party. Public cloud service providers have different strengths, and they offer a wide variety of services and pricing models. Companies that are considering a migration to public cloud need to carefully consider their options when it comes to choosing a provider, especially if they will be locked into a long-term contract. Careful planning can help to keep costs down on monthly cloud services bills, but organizations with unpredictable public cloud usage may find it hard to avoid spending a lot of money on public cloud services when usage suddenly surges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because servers in the public cloud share data from multiple companies, security in public cloud is another issue that IT managers will want to weigh. Encrypting data is a good way to ensure stronger security, but if you are using a combination of public and private cloud (also known as a hybrid cloud), not all encryption platforms work across both public and private clouds. There is also an inherent security risk whenever data is moved between a private data center or private cloud and a public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last consideration is the location of your public cloud service provider. Data privacy laws in many countries require certain types of data to be stored in-country. These laws change frequently, so it’s a good idea to choose a cloud service provider that is located in your country and can confirm that the servers where your data will be stored are local and in compliance with regional laws. There is also the issue of latency—if your data is being hosted on a different continent, it may take longer than if it were stored close by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What makes PUBLIC CLOUD?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resource allocation: Tenants outside the provider’s firewall share cloud services and virtual resources that come from the provider’s set of infrastructure, platforms, and software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use agreements: Resources are distributed on an as-needed basis, but pay-as-you-go models aren’t necessary components. Some customers—like the handful of research institutions using the Massachusetts Open Cloud—use public clouds at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Management: At a minimum, the provider maintains the hardware underneath the cloud, supports the network, and manages the virtualization software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Serverless Computing or Function as a Service(FaaS) - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/05/serverless-computing-as-a-service"/>
   <updated>2021-02-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/05/Serverless-Computing-as-a-service</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;FAAS - Function as a Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a serverless way to execute modular pieces of code on the edge. FaaS lets developers write and update a piece of code on the fly, which can then be executed in response to an event, such as a user clicking on an element in a web application. This makes it easy to scale code and is a cost-efficient way to implement microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How FAAS works?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FaaS gives developers an abstraction for running web applications in response to events, without managing servers. For example, uploading a file could trigger custom code that transcodes the file into a variety of formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FaaS infrastructure is usually metered on-demand by the service provider, primarily through an event-driven execution model, so it’s there when you need it but it doesn’t require any server processes to be running constantly in the background, like platform-as-a-service (PaaS) would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern PaaS solutions offer serverless capabilities as part of common workflows that developers can use to deploy applications, blurring the lines between PaaS and FaaS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, entire applications will be composed of a mix of these solutions: functions, microservices, and long running services&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What are Microservices ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a web application were a work of visual art, using microservice architecture would be like making the art out of a collection of mosaic tiles. The artist can easily add, replace, and repair one tile at a time. Monolithic architecture would be like painting the entire work on a single piece of canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4e84fm8.png&quot; style=&quot;height:40%; width:80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach of building an application out of a set of modular components is known as microservice architecture. Dividing an application into microservices is appealing to developers because it means they can create and modify small pieces of code which can be easily implemented into their codebases. This is in contrast to monolithic architecture, in which all the code is interwoven into one large system. With large monolithic systems, even a minor changes to the application requires a hefty deploy process. FaaS eliminates this deploy complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using serverless code like FaaS, web developers can focus on writing application code, while the serverless provider takes care of server allocation and backend services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Popular FAAS providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openfaas.com/&quot;&gt;OpenFaaS (OpenSource)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of FAAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taken in consideration there are many points which makes this model best for the cloud computing. Those are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved developer velocity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Builtin scalablity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cost efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As listed, MBAAS is better in all the terms compared to all other traditional models and all comparative models like PAAS and IAAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Disadvantages of FAAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less System Control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More difficult to test the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Mobile Backend as a Service(MBaaS) - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/04/mobile-backend-as-a-service"/>
   <updated>2021-02-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;MBAAS - Mobile Backend as a Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), also known as “backend as a service”, is a model for providing web app and mobile app developers with a way to link their applications to backend cloud storage and APIs exposed by back end applications while also providing features such as user management, push notifications, and integration with social networking services. These services are provided via the use of custom software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs). BaaS is a relatively recent development in cloud computing, with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A9zu5ca.png&quot; style=&quot;height:40%; width:80%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Mobile Backend-as-a-Service mBaaS providers have been around for just a few years, they have become highly influential in the technology industry, especially the mobile app development sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern-day apps provide various services, including push notifications, APIs, analytics, data, security, authentication, and the list goes on. MBaaS acts as a bridge for developers, giving them access to tools they need to develop top-notch apps with innovative features mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are considering using MBaaS to create an app for your business or startup, you are on the right track. This article will give you a brief overview of the MBaaS industry and the key players you should consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, MBaaS offers a number of backend development benefits compared to building and managing backend resources manually. Backendless, specifically, offers the most functionality of any MBaaS provider with a user-friendly interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of MBAAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taken in consideration there are many points which makes this model best for the cloud computing. Those are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Standardized coding environment enables faster and easier coding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search, data storage and authentication are ready to use features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security and backup infrastructure is ready to use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developers can clone apps with ease&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using an MBaaS is recommended for running standalone applications for mobile platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As listed, MBAAS is better in all the terms compared to all other traditional models and all comparative models like PAAS and IAAS.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Platform as a Service(PaaS) - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/03/platform-as-a-service"/>
   <updated>2021-02-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;PAAS - Platform as a Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that allows customers to provision, instantiate, run, and manage a modular bundle comprising a computing platform and one or more applications, without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching the application(s); and to allow developers to create, develop, and package such software bundles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure – servers, storage and networking – but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems and more. PaaS is designed to support the complete web application life cycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing software licences, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware, container orchestrators such as Kubernetes or the development tools and other resources. You manage the applications and services that you develop, and the cloud service provider typically manages everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of PAAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taken in consideration there are many points which makes this model best for the cloud computing. Those are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut coding times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding development capablities without adding more staff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop for multiple platforms – including mobile – more easily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use sophisticated tools affordably&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support geographically distributed development teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Efficiently manage the application life cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As listed, PAAS is better in all the terms compared to all other traditional models and all comparative models like PAAS and IAAS.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Software as a Service(SaaS) - Cloud Computing</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/02/02/software-as-a-service"/>
   <updated>2021-02-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/02/02/Software-as-a-service</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;SAAS - Software as a Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS stands for software as a service, which means software is hosted by a third-party provider and delivered to customers over the internet as a service. While most SaaS products are aimed at business users, some products have proved popular with individual consumers, like note-taking app Evernote or personal finance tools like TurboTax and Mint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business settings, users access productivity applications or enterprise software from a service provider instead of from their company’s private data center. Microsoft 365 and Salesforce are common examples of such SaaS software used in business that had been previously hosted and distributed by businesses’ own data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS is a marked difference to the old model of making a one-off purchase of software that must be hosted, implemented, and maintained by the buyers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SaaS delivery model is enabled by a multitenant architecture, where a service provider can distribute multiple versions of the same software from a single physical server. Each user or business has its own version of the application, with the associated customizations, data, and access controls, but from a shared code base that can be patched, updated, and maintained centrally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, software can be purchased by individuals or for a select group of users and paid for on a monthly or annual subscription basis per “seat,” instead of making a large upfront investment in a perpetual (permanent) license, starting a lengthy implementation, and committing to years of maintenance, upgrades, and support contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages of SAAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Taken in consideration there are many points which makes this model best for the cloud computing. Those are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduced time to Benifit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower Costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scalablity and Integration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Releases / Upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to use and perform proof-of-concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As listed, SAAS is better in all the terms compared to all other traditional models and all comparative models like PAAS and IAAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers’ varying requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is cryptocurrency?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2021/01/31/what-is-cryptocurrency"/>
   <updated>2021-01-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2021/01/31/ What-is-cryptocurrency-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;CRYPTOCURRENCY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto algorithms are around in the computer domain since 1983 but the induction of hashing and development of blockchain came to the public around 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto and after the publication of a research paper which was empathizing on proof of work algorithm, a new cryptocurrency came up named Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more than &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;6000 cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in existence today in 2021. The major chunk of them was developed in the last decade. Those are all working in different algorithms like proof of stake or proof of work, there are dozen more algorithms available over the internet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What is Cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
According to &lt;em&gt;Jan Lansky&lt;/em&gt;, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system does not require a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Central Authority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;proved exclusively cryptographically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;performs at most one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous things more which we need to understand to know more about the working of cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Banks could retaliate to the blockchain industry</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2020/12/31/how-banks-could-retaliate"/>
   <updated>2020-12-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2020/12/31/How-Banks_Could_retaliate?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How should banks react?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the financial service industry is moving from the exploration phase to the application phase for blockchain, banks need to understand the future role of blockchain and its impact on banking services if they want to take advantage of this financial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success will depend on how banks quickly respond to opportunities for innovation. Used effectively, disruption is key to driving organizational change and taking the business to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption can be a valuable way for banks to reinvent their organization by challenging competitors and identifying growth opportunities. To be able to work effectively in the new eco-system, banks should identify radically new ways to conduct business. They, therefore, have to change their old business models and personal skills and create new, viable models for the blockchain age to be able to combat new competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s a very interesting space to watch. It’s clear that blockchain has the potential to make finance more efficient, but the big players are well-established. And establishments don’t tend to favour innovation. I’d keep an eye on the start-ups who want to disrupt, but also know how to play nice with the institutions.”&lt;/em&gt; Jeff Koyen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Forward thinking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the process of disruption triggered by blockchain technology has only just begun, many expect it to speed up soon. This and the coming years we will – as a result - see a lot of changes in the banking industry, while new players will enter the market. Blockchain may eliminate some roles in financial services in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the financial industry is thrilled about blockchain, the technology will take a few years to become a mainstream financial model. That means that disruption will happen gradually – but surely. In the meantime, banks have the time to prepare and adjust so that they can have a “second life” in a blockchain world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way blockchain is driving disruption in the traditional financial services industry is however not straightforward but may occur in both obvious and not so obvious ways. The future of the financial services industry will thereby depend on how the various stakeholders including banks capitalize on this technology and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when financial institutions fully adopt this technology, we should see these gained efficiencies in the form of lower fees for consumers, creating a renewed promising customer experience by banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, these banks may survive ….&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Blockchain Could Disrupt Banking Industry?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2020/12/01/how-blockchain-could-distupt-banking"/>
   <updated>2020-12-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2020/12/01/How-Blockchain_Could_Distupt-Banking-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In today’s day and age, banks are the most important key point in the whole finance ecosystem where they serve as the critical storehouses and transfer hubs of value. Now with the induction of Blockchain in this domain, the role of banks in the transaction and the value of fiat currency is going down day by day hence there could be a scenario where blockchain could propose a big threat to large institutions like JP Morgan and Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What makes blockchain (so) disruptive for banks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The answer to this question lies in the three specific in-build properties of a blockchain: Decentralized, distributed and Immutability. These differ completely from those of banks that are centralized organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Decentalized Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Blockchain operates on a decentralized network, that is acting on a peer-to-peer basis. It handles all operations similar to a bank, but without any central authority that monitors all data. So it potentially cuts out the middleman, giving back the power to the owner of the assets (i.e. data or tokens carrying some financial value). All information is stored across its network via blocks. These blocks, which are time-stamped and linked together with all past and current transactions, are permanently recorded and consistently reconciled and updated in a cryptographically secure way. By storing data across its network, blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Distributed Ledger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second property of blockchain is the distributed ledger, that allows sharing of a ledger of activity - such as arbitrary data or virtually anything of value between multiple parties. What makes blockchain so important is its ability to automate trust and transparency among all parties using it. Because the ledger is distributed among all transaction participants, it exists simultaneously in multiple places. Each of the computers in the distributed network maintains a copy of the ledger to ensure transparency and also prevent a single point of failure and all copies are updated and validated simultaneously. This makes it extremely difficult to manipulate entries or tamper with the data without the other parties noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Immutable Records&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A third unique property is its immutability. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of data. All blockchain networks adhere to a certain protocol for validating new blocks. No changes can be made once the system is set with the initial standards. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered without the alteration of all the subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of the network majority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Where will be blockchain hit on the Banks ??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Though blockchain is said to have an impact on virtually every aspect of the financial system, most disruptive use cases can be found in activities such as cross border payments and remittances, share trading, clearing and settlement, trade finance and supply chain finance, regulatory reporting and compliance, as well as smart contracts. It is however clear that when the technology further evolves there will be many more areas for applying the blockchain technologies emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Cross border payments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 It is not surprising that payments are emerging as the first and foremost blockchain use case of any banking and/or financial system. Nowadays payments across borders are a time-consuming and expensive process, given the need for correspondent banks or other intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Blockchain offers an easy and secure solution, as it will not require third party authorization. . By cutting out many of the traditional middlemen, the laborious and costly process of cross border payments is simplified, thus significantly speeding up the cross-border payment process and that at a cost much less than with the traditional banking systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Share Trading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Using blockchain for buying and selling stocks and shares could also bring several significant benefits. Share trading involves many third parties, such as brokers, CCPs, CSDs and exchanges, making this process time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The decentralized nature of blockchain technology can remove all those intermediaries and enable trading to be run on computers all over the world. Eliminating some of the middlemen from the share trading process speeds up the settlement process and allows for greater trade accuracy. Trading transactions in blockchain thereby reduces the redundancy of information and thus improves performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Clearing and settlement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 The global cash settlement for fixed income, equity, and derivative products in various currencies is slow, costly, and complicated. Because of the large number of parties involved, It takes several days to settle.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By eliminating a large number of intermediaries, blockchain enables instantaneous settlement leading to substantially lower costs&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Trade Finance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Many trade finance activities still involve lots of paperwork, such as bills of lading, invoices, letters of credit etc. All participants in the trade chain must maintain their database for all transaction-related documents, that must be constantly reconciled against each other. It is as a result a time-consuming activity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Blockchain-based trade finance can streamline the entire trading process by getting rid of this time-consuming paperwork and bureaucracy. It eliminates the need for several copies of the same document and can integrate all necessary information in one digital document, which is updated in real-time and can be accessed by all network members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Digital Identity Verification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Another area where customer experience could be significantly improved when using blockchain is in the digital identity verification process. Online financial transactions require a lot of steps to be taken, including face-to-face checking, authentication, authorization etc. All of these steps need to be taken for each new service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Blockchain makes it possible to securely re-use identity verification for other services. With blockchain, users can choose how they identify themselves and with whom they agree to share their identity. They still need to register their identity on the blockchain, but they do not need to repeat the registration for each service provider if those providers are also powered by blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Smart contracts are another way to fundamentally change the way business is done nowadays. The functions of a bank such as lending, deposits, treasury, investment advice, business intelligence, regulatory compliance, payments, and remittances will be disrupted by using these contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Through the use of smart contracts, blockchain technology will change the way information and money are exchanged in finance (and in many other industries). Smart contracts enable operating and automating business processes in a fully decentralized fashion, enabling shared rules of engagement, conduct, and business processes to be automated and enforced ecosystem-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Intensive collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 The blockchain-based bank ecosystem will be one of intensive collaboration, within an increasingly open banking environment, not only with other banks but also with various third parties in the financial chain. Whether the third party is a payment processor, a fintech startup or a creative app developer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Future success will depend on their willingness to co-operate – even with the apparent challengers to their core activities. Banks don’t have a choice in this – not if they want to survive and prosper. Although it might seem counterintuitive to banks to facilitate new services beyond their immediate control and balance sheets, standing in the way of external creativity and innovation carries the greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Bank-fintech partnerships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Even as the disruptions continue, the ecosystem will see deeper collaboration between financial institutions and fintech firms and the creation of platform companies to meet the changing needs of their customers. While fintech companies have the advantage of innovation, financial institutions provide a sandbox for proof of concept and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most fintech start-ups lack several features for a stand-alone existence, that are well known for traditional banks. Fintech firms need to be wary of product functionality, flexibility, scalability and compliance. Banks have the advantages of greater resources and a larger scale. Good partnerships between banks and fintech could bring the best for both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the domains in which banks could face the competition and could potentially lose ground against Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is the weakness of Blockchain?? (Everything isn't perfect!!)</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/12/01/what-are-weaknes-of-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-12-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/12/01/what-are-weaknes-of-Blockchain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;1. There is no customer protection on the blockchain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Blockchain technology operates as a push-based settlement system. This means the individual holds power over the resource they want to verify on the blockchain. This could be in cryptos, certificate authentication, land titles, etc. The problem with this is if a transaction goes sour after it has already been verified on the blockchain, the only feasible way of returning the transaction is if the parties agree to reverse it. Using a  centralized system like a bank. However, there is a procedure in place to be able to dispute trades after they are complete. Some trade technologies that settle on a blockchain have used an arbiter system to fix this problem, an example of this is the Open Bazaar P2P  trade network. This way trade occurs between two people and one impartial moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;2. Settlement on a blockchain is slow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A  cost of settling a transaction on the blockchain is that all the nodes in the network need to come to an agreement that the transaction is valid. This is a far slower process than having a bank verify your transaction in an instant. Transactions can be made instantaneously, however until the block in which the transaction is inserted has been verified, it is classified as untrustworthy. In the time between a lodged transaction is made and when the block settles, a bad actor could launch fraudulent transactions to trick the network into what is known as double spend. A  very exciting upcoming technology that could solve this problem is the lightning network. This solution acts as layer 2 of blockchain technology; it can be applied to any public blockchain. It will enable instantly verified transactions for a fraction of the cost of today’s settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;3. Miners can be selfish &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The mining process on the blockchain is an innovation that uses game theory economics to incentivize people to commit computer power for securing the network for a profit. The downside of this is generally miners won’t care about settling as many transactions as possible; they will make the most money by finding and verifying a block in the fastest way possible. This leads to a problem of miners finding empty blocks and validating. There is also another problem known as Selfish Mining, which is a situation where a miner or mining pool finds and validates a block and does not publish and distribute a valid solution to the rest of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;4. The growing blockchain size &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; With  every new block, a blockchain grows. This can be an issue because each node that is validating the network needs to store the entire history of the blockchain to be a participant. This is a hard enough problem with the bitcoin blockchain where the transaction size is only a  few bytes, the total blockchain size as of January 2017 is 98GB. Given that at the same time in 2016 the size was 50GB, and the use of the blockchain is continuing to increase, this is a growing concern. One of the biggest debates in the bitcoin space is if the block size should be increased. If a blockchain has bigger blocks the blockchain size will increase faster, thus weeding out the solo miners eventually. This is a big issue because the health of a blockchain network is partially dependent on the number of nodes in the network, and the spread of those nodes across the world. The counterargument for this issue is that with sufficient advancement of technology hard disk space will be very cheap in the future and will stay ahead of the blockchain size. The debate is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;5. Eventually, a settlement on the blockchain will not be cheap &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; On any public blockchain, space in a block is a finite resource.  Necessarily as the network is utilized more the amount of transactions that will want to settle in a block will exceed the storage capacity.  Public blockchain networks have a solution built-in for this which is that transactions with a higher miner fee attached will get precedence to be included in a block. This makes sense because the miners want to maximize their profit so that they will include transactions with the highest fees first. This is not a bug, but a feature. If it were free to settle on the blockchain, there would be far too many ways of attacking the blocks with dust transactions and clogging up the network. Originally the bitcoin blockchain had no block size limit; this was eventually set to  1MB to avoid a Sybil Attack on the network. All of these problems have potential solutions that can be implemented as a  fix. In my view, blockchains will eventually have layers of centralization like the lightning network. However, this is not a bad thing so long as there is a sufficient amount of encryption to protect the privacy of the people who want to use the centralized layers of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What if we combine Blockchain and Cloud Computing?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/10/31/what-if-we-combine-blockchain-and-cloud"/>
   <updated>2019-10-31T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/10/31/What-if-we-combine-blockchain-and-cloud</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology is distributed ledger with records of data containing all details of the transaction carried out and distributed among the nodes present in the network. All the transactions carried out previously are &lt;strong&gt;saved and then they are reflected&lt;/strong&gt; in the next upcoming block hash. Hence it is an &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;intangible and immutable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; data structure at the basic end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is well-defined technology that emerged from &lt;strong&gt;large-scale distributed computing technology&lt;/strong&gt;. Cloud computing helps to reduce the burden on the resources and lets the user use the optimum resources for redundant work. Organizations like Google or Microsoft have large data servers and then the employees could get the required resources out of it. This helps the organization to have the flexibility of resources according to the projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some evident issues in cloud computing which are Data Security, Data Management, Interoperability etc. By having the Blockchain concept with the cloud we could solve all of the issues or &lt;strong&gt;technical bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; which we are facing at the moment with cloud computing. Blockchain technology is an emerging technology well known for its &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;security and authenticity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which are the main characteristics that are making the world turn to its side. By integrating blockchain with cloud computing, there will be many advantages in usability, trust, security, scalability, data management, and many other advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several projects and Ideas which are working progressively in this direction, those are added in the references.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Where could be Blockchain be used?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/10/01/where-could-be-blockchain-used"/>
   <updated>2019-10-01T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/10/01/Where-could-be-Blockchain_used</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is freaking exciting and does have the potential to transform all of the business and how it operates, but that doesn’t mean it’s the right solution for every scenario. Here’s why you should choose blockchain  over, say, a standard outdated Centralized database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;When you want to manage and secure digital relationships or keep a decentralized, shared system of record.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Anytime you want to keep a long-term, transparent record of assets (for example, to record property or land rights ), publically available data, blockchain could be the ideal solution. Smart contracts, in particular, are great for facilitating digital relationships and transactions. With a solidity smart contract, automated payments can be released when parties in a  transaction agree that their conditions have been met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Anywhere a middleman or gatekeeper function is expensive or time-consuming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For  example, major cloud services nowadays allows user to pile up the data on the servers which are organized by a single body or corporate like Google or Amazon, these services charges immensely instead of the single data serves system we could use decentralized systems like DCS-BBN or SIA data systems which are backed by the blockchain and have an ecosystem of the hosts and consumers which provides storage for the rent on lower tariffs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;When you want to record secure transactions, especially between multiple partners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A  traditional database may be good for recording simple transactions between two parties, but when things get more complicated, blockchain can reduce bottlenecks and simplify relationships. For example, shipping conglomerate Maersk is working with IBM to develop a private blockchain platform to connect its various partners and customers across the shipping industry. What’s more, the added security of a decentralized system makes blockchain ideal for transactions in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Where the data is in constant flux, but you want to keep a record of past actions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  Blockchain is a better, safer way to record the activity and keep data fresh while maintaining a record of its history. The data can’t be  corrupted by anyone or accidentally deleted, and you benefit from both a  historical trail of data, plus an instantly up-to-date record&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is the initial coin offering in Blockchain?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/10/what-is-cryptocurrency-ico"/>
   <updated>2019-09-10T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/10/What-is-Cryptocurrency-ICO?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;initial coin offering (ICO)&lt;/strong&gt; or initial currency offering is a type of funding using cryptocurrencies. It is often a form of crowdfunding, although a private ICO which does not seek public investment is also possible. In an ICO, a quantity of cryptocurrency is sold in the form of “tokens” (“coins”) to speculators or investors, in exchange for legal tender or other (generally established and more stable) cryptocurrencies such as &lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin or Ether&lt;/strong&gt;. The tokens are promoted as future functional units of currency if or when the ICO’s funding goal is met and the project successfully launches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are a popular fundraising method used primarily by startups wishing to offer products and services, usually related to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ICOs are similar to stocks, but they sometimes have utility for a software service or product offered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some ICOs have yielded massive returns for investors. Numerous others have turned out to be fraud or have failed or performed poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To participate in an ICO, you will usually need to purchase a digital currency first and have a basic understanding of how to use cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ICOs are, for the most part, completely unregulated, so investors must exercise a high degree of caution and diligence when researching and investing in ICOs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When a cryptocurrency startup wants to raise money through ICO, it usually creates a whitepaper that outlines what the project is about, the need the project will fulfill upon completion, how much money is needed, how many of the virtual tokens the founders will keep, what type of money will be accepted, and how long the ICO campaign will run for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the ICO campaign, enthusiasts and supporters of the project buy some of the project’s tokens with fiat or digital currency. These coins are referred to the buyers as tokens and are similar to shares of a company sold to investors during an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the money raised does not meet the minimum funds required by the firm, the money may be returned to the backers; at this point, the ICO would be deemed unsuccessful. If the funding requirements are met within the specified timeframe, the money raised is used to pursue the goals of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Special Considerations &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Investors looking to buy into ICOs should first familiarize themselves with the cryptocurrency space more broadly. In the case of most ICOs, investors must purchase tokens with pre-existing cryptocurrencies. This means that an ICO investor will need to already have a cryptocurrency wallet set up for a currency like bitcoin or ethereum, as well as having a wallet capable of holding whichever token or currency they want to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How are ICOs regulated?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ICOs are largely unregulated. In the United States, there aren’t any regulations that apply specifically to ICOs. However, if an ICO fits the classification of a securities offering, then it falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction and is regulated by federal securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries have taken a strict stance and banned ICOs entirely. Countries that have banned ICOs include China, Nepal, Bangladesh, Macedonia, Bolivia, and Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What are ATMs in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/09/what-is-cryptocurrency-atm"/>
   <updated>2019-09-09T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/09/What-is-Cryptocurrency-ATM?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Bitcoin ATMs (Automated Teller Machine)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are kiosks that allows a person to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by using cash or debit card. Some Bitcoin ATMs offer bi-directional functionality enabling both the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the sale of Bitcoin for cash. In some cases, Bitcoin ATM providers require users to have an existing account to transact on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;There are two main types of Bitcoin machines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unidirectional (one-way)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bidirectional (two-way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only about 30% of all crypto ATMs worldwide are bidirectional, and less than 23% in the U.S. Both types are connected to the Internet, allowing for cash purchase and/or sale of Bitcoin. Some machines use a paper receipt and others move money to a public key on the blockchain. Bitcoin cash kiosks look like traditional ATMs, but do not connect to a bank account and instead connect the user directly to a Bitcoin wallet or exchange. While some Bitcoin ATMs are traditional ATMs with revamped software, they do not require a bank account or debit card. On average, transaction fees are 10-20% but can go as high as 25% and as low as 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What Is a Bitcoin ATM?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A bitcoin ATM is an Internet-connected kiosk that allows customers to purchase bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies with deposited cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bitcoin ATM is not the same as an automated teller machine (ATM) that allows bank customers to physically withdraw, deposit, or transfer funds in one’s bank account. Rather, bitcoin ATMs produce blockchain-based transactions that send cryptocurrencies to the user’s digital wallet, often via the use of a QR code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A bitcoin ATM is a standalone device or kiosk that allows members of the public to buy or sell bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for a terminal.
Bitcoin ATMs are connected to the Internet and often utilize QR codes to send and receive tokens to users’ digital wallets.
There are currently more than 14,000 bitcoin ATMs in operation around the world&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Automatic Swaps in Blockchain</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/08/what-is-automativ-swaps-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-08T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/08/What-is-Automativ-Swaps-in-Blockchain-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An atomic swap is a smart contract technology that enables the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without using centralized intermediaries, such as exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atomic swaps can take place directly between blockchains of different cryptocurrencies, or they can be conducted off-chain, away from the main blockchain. They first came into prominence in September 2017, when an atomic swap between Decred and Litecoin was conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, other startups and decentralized exchanges have allowed users the same facility. For example, Lightning Labs, a startup that uses bitcoin’s lightning network for transactions, has conducted off-chain swaps using the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges, such as 0x and Altcoin.io, have also incorporated the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How do atomic swaps work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Atomic swap protocols are designed in a way that prevents any of the involved parties from cheating. To understand how they work, let’s imagine that Alice wants to trade her Litecoins (LTC) for Bob’s Bitcoins (BTC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Alice deposits her LTC into a contract address that acts like a safe. When this safe is created, Alice also generates a key to access it. She then shares a cryptographic hash of this key with Bob. Note that Bob can’t access the LTC yet because he only has the hash of the key and not the key itself.
Next, Bob uses the hash provided by Alice to create another safe contract address, in which he deposits his BTC. To claim the BTC, Alice is required to use that same key and, by doing so, she reveals it to Bob (thanks to a special function called hash lock). This means that as soon as Alice claims the BTC, Bob can claim the LTC and the swap is complete.
The term ‘atomic’ relates to the fact that these transactions either happen entirely or not at all. If any of the parties give up or fail to do what they are supposed to, the contract is cancelled, and the funds are automatically returned to their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atomic swaps can happen in two different ways: on-chain and off-chain. On-chain atomic swaps happen on either of the currency’s networks (in this case, either the Bitcoin or Litecoin blockchain). Off-chain atomic swaps, on the other hand, take place on a secondary layer. This kind of atomic swap is usually based on bidirectional payment channels, similar to the ones used in the Lightning Network.
Technically speaking, most of these trustless trading systems are based on smart contracts that use multi-signatures and Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While Hash Timelock Contracts (HTLC) are an important part of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, they are also one of the key components that makes atomic swaps possible. As the name suggests, they are based on two key functions: a hash lock and a timelock.
A hash lock is what prevents funds from being spent unless a piece of data is revealed (Alice’s key in the previous example). Timelock is a function that ensures the contract can only be executed within a predefined timeframe. Consequently, the use of HTLCs removes the need for trust because they create a specific set of rules that prevent atomic swaps from executing partially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The biggest advantages of atomic swaps are all related to their decentralized nature. By removing the need for a centralized exchange or any other kind of mediator, cross-chain swaps can be executed by two (or more) parties without requiring them to trust each other. There is also an increased level of security because users don’t need to give their funds to a centralized exchange or third party. Instead, the trades can happen directly from users’ wallets.
Also, this form of peer-to-peer trading has much lower operational costs as trading fees are either very low or absent. Lastly, atomic swaps make it possible for trades to happen very quickly, with higher degrees of interoperability. In other words, altcoins can be swapped directly without making use of Bitcoin or Ethereum as an intermediary coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are a few conditions that need to be met for an atomic swap to take place, and these may likely present obstacles for the technique to be widely adopted. For instance, to perform an atomic swap, the two cryptocurrencies need to be based on blockchains that share the same hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256 for Bitcoin). They also need to be compatible with HTLC and other programmable functionalities.
Other than that, atomic swaps bring up concerns about user’s privacy. That’s because on-chain swaps and transactions can be quickly tracked on a blockchain explorer, making it easy to link the addresses. A short-term answer to this problem is to use privacy-focused cryptocurrencies as a way to reduce exposure. Still, many developers are experimenting with the use of digital signatures in atomic swaps as a more reliable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What are Crypto Exchanges?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/07/what-is-exchanges-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-07T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/07/What-is-Exchanges-in-Blockchain-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What are Cryptocurrency Exchanges?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;A crypto exchange is a platform on which you can buy and sell cryptocurrency.&lt;/span&gt; You can use exchanges to trade one crypto for another — converting Bitcoin to Litecoin, for example — or to buy crypto using regular currency, like the U.S. Dollar. Exchanges reflect current market prices of the cryptocurrencies they offer. You can also convert cryptocurrencies back into the U.S. Dollar or another currency on an exchange, to leave as cash within your account (if you want to trade back into crypto later) or withdraw to your regular bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms in which you can exchange one kind of digital asset for another based on the market value of the given assets. The most popular exchanges are currently Binance and GDAX. It is important not to confuse cryptocurrency exchanges for cryptocurrency wallets or wallet brokerages. Cryptocurrency wallets and wallet brokerages generally allow you to buy and sell a small range of popular digital assets (Bitcoin and Ethereum), which you can then send to a different exchange to trade for other digital assets like altcoins. This statement is not entirely exclusive though; most cryptocurrency exchanges will usually limit their users to only trade digital assets for digital assets, but a few allow trades of fiat currencies such as U.S. Dollars for cryptocurrencies. An example of such an exchange is Kraken, which currently accepts funds in the form of USD, JPY, CAD, and GBP, and supports trades with Monero, Ripple, and Litecoin as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;There’s no one crypto exchange that’s best for every user,&lt;/span&gt; says Tyrone Ross, a financial advisor and CEO of Onramp Invest, a crypto investment platform for financial advisors. Instead, he says it helps to evaluate your own interests when it comes to crypto, and find an exchange that aligns with your goals. For example, maybe you’re looking for a specific coin, or you want to continue learning more as you get into crypto investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Things to look for in Crypto Exchanges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Liquidity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coins offered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Educational tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tax information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the points which should be took in the consideration while choosing the appropriate crypto wallet to buy Crypto currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is Transaction Fees in Blockchain?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/06/what-is-transaction-fees-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-06T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/06/What-is-Transaction-Fees-in-Blockchain-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The blockchain fee is a cryptocurrency transaction fee that is &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;charged to users when performing crypto transactions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The fee is collected in order to process the transaction on the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to pay the blockchain fee to ensure your cryptocurrency transfers arrive in a timely manner. The blockchain fee is &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;one of the main tools used to speed up crypto transactions,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which are often slow due to high congestion on the blockchain network. The lower the blockchain fee, the lower your transaction’s priority in the blockchain network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;supply of network capacity at the time,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction. The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest. Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ether, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.017, while for bitcoin it corresponded to $0.55.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why blockchain is portrayed as anonymous?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/05/what-is-anonimity-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-05T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/05/What-is-Anonimity-in-Blockchain-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is public for all but the information saved in the blockchain is not public for all the users as it comes up with SHA encryption and the information is only accessed while verification of the data by the legitimacy miners only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about anonymity in the terms of Blockchain and cryptocurrency we could look for some points listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing to take in the consideration is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;BLOCKCHAIN AREN”T ANONYMOUS BUT THEY ARE PSEDUONYMOUS! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to how authors will sometimes write under a pseudonym, you send and receive cryptocurrency using a pseudonym. Instead of a fictitious name, though, your blockchain pseudonym is your public address. This long string of numbers and letters doesn’t contain any identifiable information that would tie you to the address or its associated wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a public hash of 32 bit like, 567sdf89h..v56eg4 this and this is available publically in the blockchain domain but no one could undermine that what this means!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the complicated addresses mask your identity, many people think that activity on a blockchain is anonymous. While public addresses protect your privacy to some extent, other blockchain features tend to expose you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <title>What are Crypto wallets in Blockchan and Cryptocurrencies ?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/04/what-is-wallet-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-04T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/04/What-is-Wallet-in-Blockchain-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet, which makes using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going in depth we could signify the defination for the crypto wallets like, &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Crypto wallets store your private keys, keeping your crypto safe and accessible. They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Understanding how crypto wallets work &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Blockchain is a public ledger that stores data in what’s known as “blocks.” These are records of all transactions, the balances held at any given address, and who holds the key to those balances. Crypto isn’t stored “in” a wallet, per se. The coins exist on a blockchain and the wallet software allows you to interact with the balances held on that blockchain. The wallet itself stores addresses and allows their owners to move coins elsewhere while also letting others see the balance held at any given address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most Crypto wallets allow users to send, receive, and store crypto. Some have a feature to buy and spend cryptocurrencies,”&lt;/em&gt; says Utsav Dar, co-founder of Incub8 Finance. &lt;em&gt;“Certain crypto wallets have additional features like swapping between tokens, staking tokens for a fixed return paid out to users, as well as access to dApps (decentralized applications) built on various networks.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each wallet has its own specific nuances, here are the general steps involved in sending or receiving funds using a crypto wallet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;To receive funds,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you need to retrieve an address (also known as a public key) from your wallet. Locate the “generate address” feature in your wallet, click it, then copy the alphanumeric address or QR code and share it with the person who wants to send you crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;To send funds,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you need the address of the receiving wallet. Locate the “send” feature in your wallet and enter an address of the wallet you intend to send coins to. Select the amount of crypto you’d like to send, and click “confirm.” Consider sending a small test transaction before sending large amounts of crypto. Note that sending coins requires a fee that will be paid to miners in exchange for processing the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending money via QR codes or long strings of numbers and letters may seem strange at first. But after doing it a few times, the process becomes quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How do you use a crypto wallet?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Crypto wallets range from simple-to-use apps to more complex security solutions. The main types of wallets you can choose from include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Paper wallets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Keys are written on a physical medium like paper and stored in a safe place. This of course makes using your crypto harder, because as digital money it can only be used on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Hardware wallets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Keys are stored in a thumb-drive device that is kept in a safe place and only connected to a computer when you want to use your crypto. The idea is to try to balance security and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Online wallets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Keys are stored in an app or other software – look for one that is protected by two-step encryption. This makes sending, receiving, and using your crypto as easy as using any online bank account, payment system, or brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each type has its tradeoffs. Paper and hardware wallets are harder for malicious users to access because they are stored offline, but they are limited in function and risk being lost or destroyed. Online wallets offered by a major exchange like Coinbase are the simplest way to get started in crypto and offer a balance of security and easy access. (Because your private info is online, your protection against hackers is only as good as your wallet provider’s security – so make sure you look for features like two-factor verification.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What could be done with the help of Crypto Wallets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage all your digital assets in one secure place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control your own private keys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send and receive cryptocurrency to and from anywhere in the world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interact with usernames rather than long, hexadecimal “public key” addresses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Browse dapps (decentralized finance apps)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shop at stores that accept cryptocurrency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>What is Mining of Block in Blockchain and Cryptocurrency?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/03/what-is-mining-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-03T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/03/What-is-Mining-in-Blockchain?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What exactly is Blockchain mining?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A peer-to-peer computer process, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Blockchain mining is used to secure and verify Cryptocurrency transactions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Mining involves Blockchain miners who add cryptocurrencies transaction data to cryptocurrency’s global public ledger of past transactions. In the ledgers, blocks are secured by Blockchain miners and are connected forming a chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk in-depth, as opposed to traditional financial services systems, Bitcoins have no central clearinghouse. Bitcoin transactions are generally verified in &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;decentralized clearing systems wherein people contribute computing resources to verify the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This process of verifying transactions is called mining. It is probably referred to as mining as it is analogous to mining of commodities like gold—mining gold requires a lot of effort and resources, but then there is a limited supply of gold; hence, the amount of gold that is mined every year remains roughly the same. In the same manner, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;a lot of computing power is consumed in the process of mining bitcoins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The number of bitcoins that are generated from mining dwindles over time. In the words of Satoshi Nakamoto, there’s a limited supply of bitcoins—only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, the term ‘Blockchain mining’ is used to describe the process of adding transaction records to the bitcoin blockchain. This process of adding blocks to the blockchain is how transactions are processed and how money moves around securely on Bitcoins. This process of Blockchain mining is performed by a community of people around the world called ‘Blockchain miners.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can apply to become a Blockchain miner. These Blockchain miners install and run a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;special Blockchain mining software that enables their computers to communicate securely with one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Once a computer installs the software, joins the network and begins mining bitcoins, it becomes what is called a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/01/what-is-nodes-in-blockchain&quot;&gt;‘node.’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Together, all these nodes communicate with one another and process transactions to add new blocks to the blockchain which is commonly known as the bitcoin network. This bitcoin network runs throughout the day. It processes equivalent to millions of dollars in bitcoin transactions and has never been hacked or experienced downtime since its launch in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Types of Mining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are mainly three disting types of mining refereed to cryptocurrencies
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;1. Individual Mining &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When mining is done by an individual, user registration as a miner is necessary. As soon as a transaction takes place, a mathematical problem is given to all the single users in the blockchain network to solve. The first one to solve it gets rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the solution is found, all the other miners in the blockchain network will validate the decrypted value and then add it to the blockchain. Thus, verifying the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;2. Pool Mining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    In pool mining, a group of users works together to approve the transaction. Sometimes, the complexity of the data encrypted in the blocks makes it difficult for a user to decrypt the encoded data alone. So, a group of miners works as a team to solve it. After the validation of the result, the reward is then split between all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;3. Cloud Mining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Cloud mining eliminates the need for computer hardware and software. It’s a hassle-free method to extract blocks. With cloud mining, handling all the machinery, order timings, or selling profits is no longer a constant worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is hassle-free, it has its own set of disadvantages. The operational functionality is limited with the limitations on bitcoin hashing. The operational expenses increase as the reward profits are low. Software upgrades are restricted and so is the verification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Uses of Blockchain Mining&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;1. Validating Transactions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Cryptocurrencies function without a central administrator and the insecurity can be substantial with the transactions that transpire. So, what is the authentication method with such cryptocurrencies? With each transaction, new blocks are added to the blockchain in the network and the validation lies in the mining results from the blockchain miners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;2. Confirming Transactions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Miners work the blockchain mining process to confirm whether the transaction is authentic or not. All confirmed transactions are then included in the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;3. Securing Networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    With more users mining the blockchain,  the blockchain network security increases. Network security ensures that there are no fraudulent activities happening with the cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time Stamping in Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/02/what-is-timestamping-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-02T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/02/What-is-TimeStamping-in-Blockchain-!</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Trusted timestamping is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamp’s integrity is never compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is one of the fundamental aspects of technology blockchain And of course, that implies that anyone, from any part of the world, can be added to the network and can operate in it. This in turn causes, that there is no universal time code. This is because we can connect from any time zone. The timestamp is a timestamp, which is calculated according to different parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporal parameter, or timestamp, is based on an &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;instantaneous adjustment that uses a median of the timestamps returned by all nodes of the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This is due to the decentralized form of it, and seeks to keep the nodes of the network as well synchronized as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must also bear in mind that the timestamps of the blocks are not exact. This is because they do not necessarily have to be in order. However, they still offer a relative precision of between one and two hours, which gives a margin of validity. Basically, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;all the nodes are connected to the same time slot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For this, the reference is taken UTC-0 (London local time), where UTC It’s in Spanish Coordinated Universal Time. From this, the network nodes coordinate the time in which they work. Now, after storing this data, the local node calculates the displacement time between the UTC strip and the local time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adjusts between the time of the local node with the displacement of all the nodes that are connected to the network. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;This allows the network time to be adjusted constantly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This avoids manipulation and usually does with slight time variations concerning the time slot. This is done in this way because there may be many hourly rates and repetitions and other problems could occur. Therefore, a universal timestamp creation system was developed for all nodes. This system takes into account the jet lag that could exist between the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing a timestamp makes the block it is &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;impossible to be repeated in the future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, since, in addition to the time, the date of creation of the block is also stored, therefore, there is no possibility that it will be repeated hash that happened a week, two months ago, or a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What is blockchain timestamp used for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;
One of the main uses of a timestamp is to establish the parameters of the process of mining is. This is because these timestamps allow nodes to &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;correctly adjust the mining difficulty to be used for each block generation period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Timestamps help the network determine how long it takes to extract blocks for a certain period, and from there adjust the mining difficulty parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course can open the door for miners to manipulate time to lessen the difficulty. Nevertheless, Satoshi Nakamoto, foresaw this and programmed the network so that nodes ignore blocks that are outside a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;certain time range based on their own internal clock time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As a result, if a miner tried to do this, he would lose all his mining work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in the whitepaper From Bitcoin, Nakamoto explains that another functionality of the timestamp is to create a mechanism to &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;avoid double-spending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In this regard, Nakamoto wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;For our purposes, the last transaction is what counts, so we won’t mind other subsequent double-spending attempts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>What is Nodes in Blockchain?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/01/what-is-nodes-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-01T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/01/What-is-Nodes-in-Blockchain-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Node is a part of cryptocurrency that is needed to make most of the popular tokens like Bitcoin or Dogecoin function. It’s a fundamental part of the blockchain network, which is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;decentralised ledger that is used to maintain a cryptocurrency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation can vary depending on the protocol. For example, a resident network may comprise a file server, three laptops and a fax machine. In this case, the network has five nodes, each equipped with a unique MAC address to identify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What is a node in blockchain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The term &lt;em&gt;“node”&lt;/em&gt; is being used mostly about blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions and &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;makes the information available to everyone via a connected device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; What this means is every transaction has to be chronologically recorded and distributed to a series of connected devices. These devices are called nodes. These nodes communicate with each other within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a critical component of the blockchain infrastructure. It helps maintain the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;security and integrity of the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A blockchain node’s main purpose is to verify each batch of network transactions, called blocks. Each node is distinguished from others by a unique identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What do nodes do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When a miner attempts to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, it broadcasts the block to all the nodes on the network. Based on the block’s legitimacy (validity of signature and transactions), &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;nodes can accept or reject the block.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When a node accepts a new block of transactions, it saves and stores it on top of the rest of the blocks it already has stored. In short, here is what nodes do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nodes check if a block of transactions is valid and accept or reject it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nodes save and store blocks of transactions (storing blockchain transaction history).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nodes broadcast and spread this transaction history to other nodes that may need to synchronize with the blockchain (need to be updated on transaction history).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What are the types of nodes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are basically two types of nodes: &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;full nodes and lightweight nodes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Full nodes support and provide security&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to the network. These nodes download a blockchain’s entire history to observe and enforce its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Each user in the network is a lightweight node.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The lightweight node has to connect to a full node to be able to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many volunteers run full Bitcoin nodes in a bid to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of now, there are roughly &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;12,130 public nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; running on the Bitcoin network. Other than the public nodes, there are many hidden nodes (non-listening nodes). These nodes usually run behind a firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Miners’ nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is also a third type of node: Miner nodes. The term “Bitcoin miners” has now become familiar. These miners are classified as nodes. the miner may work alone (solo miner) or in groups (pool miner). A solo miner uses his full node. In a mining pool, only the administrator can run a full node — which can be referred to as a pool miner’s full node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;The difference between a miner and a node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A miner always needs to run a full node to select valid transactions to form a new block. Without a full node, it cannot determine what proposed transactions are valid according to the current blockchain’s transaction history (aka if all balances involved in the transactions are sufficient enough to perform the proposed transactions) because it does not have access to the full blockchain history. Therefore, a miner is always also a full node. A node, however, is not necessarily simultaneously a miner. A device can run a full node by receiving, storing and broadcasting all transaction data (much like a server) without actually creating new blocks of transactions itself. In this case, it functions more like a passing point with a directory, whereas a miner is the same but simultaneously tries to create new blocks of transactions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Listening nodes (supernodes)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And finally, a sub-category called listening nodes. A listening node, essentially, is a publicly visible full node. It communicates with any node that decides to establish a connection with it. A reliable super node typically runs all the time, transmitting blockchain history and transaction data to multiple nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2019-08-31T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/08/31/What-is-Blockchain-!</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is the technology that allows the user to &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;create a decentralized system of transaction and data transfers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For the naïve person, it is a method to create a people’s bank without central banks! Blockchain technology is used in the backend for each cryptocurrency. Talking about that, Blockchain is building the blocks of every critical data and then chaining the blocks. So if the last block or any previous block is changed or updated, then every information in the chain needs to be updated. This makes blockchain technology secure and more robust compared to other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;shared, immutable ledger that felicitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. An investment can be tangible (a house or a car) or intangible (Intellectual property, patents, or copyrights). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks linked together with cryptography which is also described as “trustless and fully decentralized peer to peer immutable data storage which is spread over the network of participants often referred to as the nodes. Every block contains a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;cryptographic hash of the previous block and the timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and the transaction data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s get back to basics. What is Blockchain, and how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is a file for storing data. Or, to put it in more technical terms, it’s an open, distributed database system. The data is distributed (i.e., duplicated), and the whole Blockchain is entirely decentralized. This means no one person or entity  (say, a government or corporation like Google or Microsoft) has control over the Blockchain;  this is a radical departure from the centralized (Government databases) databases controlled and administered by businesses and other entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? In straightforward terms, the file consists of blocks of data, with each block being connected to the previous block with the hashing code,  forming a chain. Hence, the name &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;“blockchain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As well as the data itself, each block also contains a record of when that block was created or edited. It contains the hash code of the previous block, which makes it very useful for maintaining a complex system of records that cannot be corrupted or lost, and this is the primary use case to preserve the integrity of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the whole Blockchain is duplicated across many computers,  any user can view the entire Blockchain in the case of public blockchains. Transactions or records are processed not by one central administrator but by a network of users who work to verify the data and achieve a consensus; these verifiers are known as miners, each miner is paid some cryptocurrency for successful mining. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Bitcoin operates in the same way. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the first example of Blockchain in action.&lt;/p&gt;
