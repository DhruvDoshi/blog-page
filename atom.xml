   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;CRYPTOCURRENCY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto algorithms are around in computer domain since 1983 but the induction of hashing and development of blockchain came in public around 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto and after the publication of research paper which was emphathising on proof of work algorithm, a new cryptocurrency came up named Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more than &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;6000 cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in existance today in 2021. Major chunk of them were developed in last decade. Those are all working in different alogithms like proof of stake or proof of work, there are dozen more algorithms avaliable over the internet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What is Cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
According to &lt;em&gt;Jan Lansky&lt;/em&gt;, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system does not require a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Central Authority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;proved exclusively cryptographically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;performs at most one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous thing more which we need to understand in order to know more about the working of cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Nodes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time Stamping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mining&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wallet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anonimity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transaction Fees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exchanges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic Swaps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ATM’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial Coin Offering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>How Banks could retaliate to the blockchian idustry</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2020/12/31/how-banks-could-retaliate"/>
   <updated>2020-12-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2020/12/31/How-Banks_Could_retaliate?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;How should banks react?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the financial service industry is moving from exploration phase to application phase for blockchain, it is very important for banks to understand the future role of blockchain and their impact on banking services if they want to take advantage of this financial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success will depend on how banks quickly respond to opportunities for innovation. Used effectively, disruption is key to driving organizational change and taking the business to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption can be a valuable way for banks  to reinvent  their organization by challenging competitors and identifying growth opportunities. In order to be able to work effectively in the new eco-system, banks should identify radically new ways to conduct business. They therefore have to change their old business models and personal skills, and create new, viable models for the blockchain age in order to be able to combat new competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s a very interesting space to watch. It’s clear that blockchain has the potential to make finance more efficient, but the big players are well-established. And establishments don’t tend to favor innovation. I’d keep an eye on the start-ups who want to disrupt, but also know how to play nice with the institutions.”&lt;/em&gt; Jeff Koyen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Forward thinking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the process of disruption triggered by blockchain technology has only just begun, many expect it to speed up soon. This and the coming years we will – as a result - see a lot of changes in the banking industry, while new players will enter the market. Blockchain may eliminate some roles in financial services in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the financial industry is thrilled about blockchain, the technology will take a few years to become a mainstream financial model. That means that disruption will happen gradually – but surely. In the meantime banks have the time to prepare and adjust so that they can have a “second live” in a blockchain world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way blockchain is driving disruption in the traditional financial services industry is however not straightforward but may occur in both obvious and not so obvious ways. The future of the financial services industry will thereby depend on how the various stakeholders including banks capitalize on this technology and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when financial institutions fully adopt this technology, we should see these gained efficiencies in the form of lower fees for consumers, creating a renewed promising customer experience by banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case these banks may survive ….&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Blockchain Could Distrupt Banking Industry?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2020/12/01/how-blockchain-could-distupt-banking"/>
   <updated>2020-12-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2020/12/01/How-Blockchain_Could_Distupt-Banking-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In todays day and age banks are the most important key point in the whole finance ecosystem where they  serve as the critical storehouses and transfer hubs of value. Now with the induction of Blockchain in this domain the role of banks in transaction and the value of fiat currency is going down day by day hence there could be a scenario where blockchain could propose a big threat to large institutions like, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What makes blockchain (so) disruptive for banks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The answer to this question lies in the three specific in-build properties of a blockchain: Decentralized, distributed and Immutability. These differ completely from those of banks that are centralised organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Decentalized Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Blockchain operates on a decentralized network, that is acting on a peer-to-peer basis. It handles all operations similar to a bank, but without any central authority that monitors all data. So it potentially cuts out the middleman, giving back the power to the owner of the assets (i.e. data or tokens carrying some financial value).All information is stored across its network via blocks. These blocks, that are time-stamped and linked together with all past and current transactions, are permanently recorded and consistently reconciled and updated in a cryptographically secure way. By storing data across its network, blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Distributed Ledger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second property of blockchain is the distributed ledger, that allows sharing of a ledger of activity - such as arbitrary data or virtually anything of value between multiple parties. What makes blockchain so important is its ability to automate trust and transparency among all parties using it. Because the ledger is distributed among all transaction participants, it exists simultaneously in multiple places. Each of the computers in the distributed network maintains a copy of the ledger to ensure transparency and also prevent a single point of failure and all copies are updated and validated simultaneously. This makes it extremely difficult to manipulate entries or tamper with the data without the other parties noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Immutable Records&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A third unique property is its immutability. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of data. All blockchain networks adhere to a certain protocol for validating new blocks. No changes can be made once the system is set with the initial standards. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered without the alteration of all the subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of the network majority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Where will be blockchain hit on the Banks ??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Though blockchain is said to have impact on virtually every aspect of the financial system, most disruptive use cases can be found in activities such as cross border payments and remittances, share trading, clearing and settlement, trade finance and supply chain finance, regulatory reporting and compliance, as well as smart contracts. It is however clear that when the technology further evolves there will be many more areas for applying the blockchain technologies emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Cross border payments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 It is not surprising that payments is emerging as the first and foremost blockchain use case of any banking and/or financial system. Nowadays payments across borders is a time-consuming and expensive process, given the need of correspondent banks or other intermediaries. .&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Blockchain offers an easy and secure solution, as it will not require third party authorization. . By cutting out many of the traditional middlemen, the laborious and costly process of cross border payments is simplified, thus significantly speeding up the cross-border payment process and that at a cost much less than with the traditional banking systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Share Trading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Using blockchain for buying and selling stocks and shares could also bring a number of significant benefits. Share trading involves many third parties, such as brokers, CCPs, CSDs and exchanges, making this process time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The decentralised nature of blockchain technology can remove all those intermediaries and enable trading to be run on computers all over the world. Eliminating some of the middlemen from the share trading process speeds up the settlement process and allows for greater trade accuracy. Trading transactions in blockchain thereby reduces the redundancy of information and thus improves performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Clearing and settlement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 The global cash settlement for fixed income, equity, and derivative products in various currencies is slow, costly, and complicated. Because of the large number of parties involved, It takes several days to settle.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By eliminating a large number of intermediaries, blockchain enables instantaneous settlement leading to substantial lower costs&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Trade Finance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Many trade finance activities still involve lots of paperwork, such as bills of lading, invoices, letters of credit etc. All participants in the trade chain must maintain their own database for all transaction-related documents, that must be constantly reconciled against each other. It is as a result a time-consuming activity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Blockchain-based trade finance can streamline the entire trading processes by getting rid of this time-consuming paperwork and bureaucracy. It eliminates the need for several copies of the same document and can integrate all necessary information in one digital document, which is updated in real time and can be accessed by all network members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Digital Identity Verification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Another area where customer experience could be significantly improved when using blockchain is in the digital identity verification process. Online financial transactions require a lot of steps to be taken, including face-to-face checking, authentication, authorisation etc. All of these steps need to be taken for each new service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Blockchain makes it possible to securely re-use the identity verification for other services. With blockchain users can choose how they identify themselves and with whom they agree to share their identity. They still need to register their identity on the blockchain, but they do not need to repeat the registration for each service provider if those providers are also powered by blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Smart contracts are another way to fundamentally change the way business is done nowadays. The functions of a bank such as lending, deposits, treasury, investment advice, business intelligence, regulatory compliance, payments, and remittances will be disrupted by using these contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Through the use of smart contracts, blockchain technology will change the way information and money is exchanged in finance (and in many other industries). Smart contracts enable operating and automating business processes in a fully decentralized fashion, enabling shared rules of engagement, conduct, and business processes to be automated and enforced ecosystem-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Intensive collaboration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 The blockchain-based bank eco system will be one of intensive collaboration, within an increasingly open banking environment, not only with other banks but also with various third parties in the financial chain. Whether the third party is a payment processor, fintech start up or creative app developer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Future success will depend on their willingness to co-operate – even with the apparent challengers to their core activities. Banks don’t really have a choice in this – not if they want to survive and prosper. Although it might seem counterintuitive to banks to facilitate new services beyond their immediate control and balance sheets, standing in the way of external creativity and innovation carries the greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Bank-fintech partnerships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
 Even as the disruptions continue, the ecosystem will see deeper collaboration between financial institutions and fintech firms and the creation of platform companies to meet the changing needs of their customers. While fintech companies have the advantage of innovation, financial institutions provide a sandbox for proof of concept and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most fintech start-ups lack a number features for a stand-alone existence, that are well known for traditional banks. Fintech firms need to be wary of product functionality, flexibility, scalability and compliance. Banks have the advantages of greater resources and larger scale. Good partnerships between banks and fintechs could bring the best for both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the domains in which banks could face the competions and could potentially loose the ground against the Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What are weakness of Blockchain??(Everything isn't perferct!!)</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/12/01/what-are-weaknes-of-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-12-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/12/01/what-are-weaknes-of-Blockchain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;1. There is no customer protection on the blockchain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Blockchain  technology operates as a push-based settlement system. This means the  individual holds power over the resource they want to verify on the  blockchain. This could be in cryptos, certificate authentication, land  titles, etc. The problem with this is if a transaction goes sour after  it has already been verified on the blockchain, the only feasible way of  returning the transaction is if the parties agree to reverse it. Using a  centralized system like a bank. However, there is a procedure in place  to be able to dispute trades after they are complete.Some  trade technologies that settle on a blockchain have used an arbiter  system to fix this problem, an example of this is the Open Bazaar P2P  trade network. This way a trade occurs between two people, and one  impartial moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;2. Settlement on a blockchain is slow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A  cost of settling a transaction on the blockchain is that all the nodes  in the network need to come to an agreement that the transaction is  valid. This is a far slower process than having a bank verify your  transaction in an instant.Transactions  can be made instantaneously, however until the block in which the  transaction is inserted in has been verified, it is classified is  untrustworthy. In the time between a lodged transaction is made and when  the block settles, a bad actor could launch fraudulent transactions to  trick the network into what is known as double spend.A  very exciting upcoming technology that could solve this problem is the  lightning network. This solution acts as a layer 2 of blockchain  technology; it can be applied to any public blockchain. It will enable  instantly verified transactions for a fraction of the cost of today’s  settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;3. Miners can be selfish &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The  mining process on the blockchain is an innovation which uses game  theory economics to incentivise people to commit computer power for  securing the network for a profit. The down-side of this is generally  miners won’t care about settling as many transactions as possible; they  will make the most money by finding and verifying a block in the fastest  way possible.This  leads to a problem of miners finding empty blocks and validating. There  is also another problem known as Selfish Mining, which is a situation  where a miner or mining pool finds and validates a block and does not  publish and distribute a valid solution to the rest of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;4. The growing blockchain size &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; With  every new block, a blockchain grows. This can be an issue because each  node that is validating the network needs to store the entire history of  the blockchain in order to be a participant. This is a hard enough  problem with the bitcoin blockchain where the transaction size is only a  few bytes, the total blockchain size as of January 2017 is 98GB. Given  that at the same time in 2016 the size was 50GB, and the use of the  blockchain is continuing to increase, this is a growing concern.One  of the biggest debates in the bitcoin space is if the block size should  be increased. If a blockchain has bigger blocks the blockchain size  will increase faster, thus weeding out the solo miners eventually. This  is a big issue because the health of a blockchain network is partially  dependent on the amount of nodes in the network, and the spread of those  nodes across the world. The counter argument for this issue is that  with sufficient advancement of technology hard disk space will be very  cheap in the future and will stay ahead of the blockchain size. The  debate is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;5. Eventually settlement on the blockchain will not be cheap &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; On  any public blockchain, space in a block is a finite resource.  Necessarily as the network is utilized more the amount of transactions  that will want to settle in a block will exceed the storage capacity.  Public blockchain networks have a solution built in for this which is  that transactions with a higher miner fee attached will get precedence  to be included in a block. This makes sense because the miners want to  maximize their profit so that they will include transactions with the  highest fees first.This  is not a bug, but a feature. If it were free to settle on the  blockchain, there would be far too many ways of attacking the blocks  with dust transactions and clogging up the network. Originally the  bitcoin blockchain had no block size limit; this was eventually set to  1MB to avoid a Sybil Attack on the network.All  of these problems have potential solutions that can be implemented as a  fix. In my view blockchains will eventually have layers of  centralisation like the lightning network. However, this is not a bad  thing so long as there is a sufficient amount of encryption to protect  the privacy of the people who want to use the centralized layers of the  network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What if we combine Blockchain and Cloud Computing ?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/10/31/what-if-we-combine-blockchain-and-cloud"/>
   <updated>2019-10-31T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/10/31/What-if-we-combine-blockchain-and-cloud</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology is distributed ledger with records of data containing all details of the transaction carried out and distributed among the nodes present in the network. All the transactions carried out previously are &lt;strong&gt;saved and then they are reflected&lt;/strong&gt; in the next upcoming block hash. Hence it is an &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;intangible and immutable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; data structure at the basic end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is well-defined technology that emerged from &lt;strong&gt;large-scale distributed computing technology&lt;/strong&gt;. Cloud computing helps to reduce the burden on the resources and lets the user use the optimum resources for redundant work. Organizations like Google or Microsoft have large data servers and then the employees could get the required resources out of it. This helps the organization to have the flexibility of resources according to the projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some evident issues in cloud computing which are Data Security, Data Management, Interoperability etc. By having the Blockchain concept with the cloud we could solve all of the issues or &lt;strong&gt;technical bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; which we are facing at the moment with cloud computing. Blockchain technology is an emerging technology well known for its &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;security and authenticity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, which are the main characteristics that are making the world turn to its side. By integrating blockchain with cloud computing, there will be many advantages in usability, trust, security, scalability, data management, and many other advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several projects and Ideas which are working progressively in this direction, those are added in the references.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Where could be Blockchian be used ?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/10/01/where-could-be-blockchain-used"/>
   <updated>2019-10-01T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/10/01/Where-could-be-Blockchain_used</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is freaking exciting and does have the potential to transform all of the business and how it operates, but that doesn’t mean it’s the right solution for every scenario. Here’s why you should choose blockchain  over, say, a standard outdated Centralized database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;When you want to manage and secure digital relationships or keep a decentralized, shared system of record.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Anytime you want to keep a long-term, transparent record of assets (for example, to record property or land rights ), publically available data, blockchain could be the ideal solution. Smart contracts, in particular, are great for facilitating digital relationships and transactions. With a solidity smart contract, automated payments can be released when parties in a  transaction agree that their conditions have been met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Anywhere a middleman or gatekeeper function is expensive or time-consuming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For  example, major cloud services nowadays allows user to pile up the data on the servers which are organized by a single body or corporate like Google or Amazon, these services charges immensely instead of the single data serves system we could use decentralized systems like DCS-BBN or SIA data systems which are backed by the blockchain and have an ecosystem of the hosts and consumers which provides storage for the rent on lower tariffs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;When you want to record secure transactions, especially between multiple partners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A  traditional database may be good for recording simple transactions between two parties, but when things get more complicated, blockchain can reduce bottlenecks and simplify relationships. For example, shipping conglomerate Maersk is working with IBM to develop a private blockchain platform to connect its various partners and customers across the shipping industry. What’s more, the added security of a decentralized system makes blockchain ideal for transactions in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Where the data is in constant flux, but you want to keep a record of past actions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  Blockchain is a better, safer way to record the activity and keep data fresh while maintaining a record of its history. The data can’t be  corrupted by anyone or accidentally deleted, and you benefit from both a  historical trail of data, plus an instantly up-to-date record&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is Blockchain?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is the technology that allows the user to &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;create a decentralized system of transaction and data transfers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For the naïve person, it is a method to create a people’s bank without central banks! Blockchain technology is used in the backend for each cryptocurrency. Talking about that, Blockchain is building the blocks of every critical data and then chaining the blocks. So if the last block or any previous block is changed or updated, then every information in the chain needs to be updated. This makes blockchain technology secure and more robust compared to other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;shared, immutable ledger that felicitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. An investment can be tangible (a house or a car) or intangible (Intellectual property, patents, or copyrights). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks linked together with cryptography which is also described as “trustless and fully decentralized peer to peer immutable data storage which is spread over the network of participants often referred to as the nodes. Every block contains a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;cryptographic hash of the previous block and the timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and the transaction data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s get back to basics. What is Blockchain, and how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is a file for storing data. Or, to put it in more technical terms, it’s an open, distributed database system. The data is distributed (i.e., duplicated), and the whole Blockchain is entirely decentralized. This means no one person or entity  (say, a government or corporation like Google or Microsoft) has control over the Blockchain;  this is a radical departure from the centralized (Government databases) databases controlled and administered by businesses and other entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? In straightforward terms, the file consists of blocks of data, with each block being connected to the previous block with the hashing code,  forming a chain. Hence, the name &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;“blockchain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As well as the data itself, each block also contains a record of when that block was created or edited. It contains the hash code of the previous block, which makes it very useful for maintaining a complex system of records that cannot be corrupted or lost, and this is the primary use case to preserve the integrity of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the whole Blockchain is duplicated across many computers,  any user can view the entire Blockchain in the case of public blockchains. Transactions or records are processed not by one central administrator but by a network of users who work to verify the data and achieve a consensus; these verifiers are known as miners, each miner is paid some cryptocurrency for successful mining. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Bitcoin operates in the same way. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the first example of Blockchain in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s get back to basics. What is Blockchain, and how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is a file for storing data. Or, to put it in more technical terms, it’s an open, distributed database system. The data is distributed (i.e., duplicated), and the whole Blockchain is entirely decentralized. This means no one person or entity  (say, a government or corporation like Google or Microsoft) has control over the Blockchain;  this is a radical departure from the centralized (Government databases) databases controlled and administered by businesses and other entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? In straightforward terms, the file consists of blocks of data, with each block being connected to the previous block with the hashing code,  forming a chain. Hence, the name &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;“blockchain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As well as the data itself, each block also contains a record of when that block was created or edited. It contains the hash code of the previous block, which makes it very useful for maintaining a complex system of records that cannot be corrupted or lost, and this is the primary use case to preserve the integrity of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the whole Blockchain is duplicated across many computers,  any user can view the entire Blockchain in the case of public blockchains. Transactions or records are processed not by one central administrator but by a network of users who work to verify the data and achieve a consensus; these verifiers are known as miners, each miner is paid some cryptocurrency for successful mining. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Bitcoin operates in the same way. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the first example of Blockchain in action.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is Nodes in Blockchain?</title>
   <link href="https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/blog/2019/09/01/what-is-nodes-in-blockchain"/>
   <updated>2019-09-01T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>https://dhruvdoshi.github.io/2019/09/01/What-is-Nodes-in-Blockchain-?</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Node is a part of cryptocurrency that is needed to make most of the popular tokens like Bitcoin or Dogecoin function. It’s a fundamental part of the blockchain network, which is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;decentralised ledger that is used to maintain a cryptocurrency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation can vary depending on the protocol. For example, a resident network may comprise a file server, three laptops and a fax machine. In this case, the network has five nodes, each equipped with a unique MAC address to identify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What is a node in blockchain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The term &lt;em&gt;“node”&lt;/em&gt; is being used mostly in relation to blockchain, a decentralised digital ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions and &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;makes the information available to everyone via a connected device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; What this means is every transaction has to be chronologically recorded and distributed to a series of connected devices. These devices are called nodes. These nodes communicate with each other within the network and transfer information about transactions and new blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a critical component of the blockchain infrastructure. It helps maintain the &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;security and integrity of the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A blockchain node’s main purpose is to verify each batch of network transactions, called blocks. Each node is distinguished from others by a unique identifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What do nodes do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When a miner attempts to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, it broadcasts the block to all the nodes on the network. Based on the block’s legitimacy (validity of signature and transactions), &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;nodes can accept or reject the block.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When a node accepts a new block of transactions, it saves and stores it on top of the rest of the blocks it already has stored. In short, here is what nodes do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nodes check if a block of transactions is valid and accept or reject it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nodes save and store blocks of transactions (storing blockchain transaction history).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nodes broadcast and spread this transaction history to other nodes that may need to synchronize with the blockchain (need to be updated on transaction history).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;What are the types of nodes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are basically two types of nodes: &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;full nodes and lightweight nodes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Full nodes support and provide security&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to the network. These nodes download a blockchain’s entire history to observe and enforce its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Each user in the network is a lightweight node.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The lightweight node has to connect to a full node to be able to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many volunteers run full Bitcoin nodes in a bid to help the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of now, there are roughly &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;12,130 public nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; running on the Bitcoin network. Other than the public nodes, there are many hidden nodes (non-listening nodes). These nodes usually run behind a firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Miners’ nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is also a third type of node: Miner nodes. The term “Bitcoin miners” has now become familiar. These miners are classified as nodes. miner may work alone (solo miner) or in groups (pool miner). A solo miner uses his own full node. In a mining pool, only the administrator can run a full node — which can be referred to as a pool miner’s full node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;The difference between a miner and a node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A miner always needs to run a full node in order to select valid transactions to form a new block. Without a full node it cannot determine what proposed transactions are valid according to the current blockchain’s transaction history (aka if all balances involved in the transactions are sufficient enough to perform the proposed transactions), because it does not have access to the full blockchain history. Therefore, a miner is always also a full node. A node however, is not necessarily simultaneously a miner. A device can run a full node by receiving, storing and broadcasting all transaction data (much like a server) without actually creating new blocks of transactions itself. In this case it functions more like a pass point with a directory, whereas a miner is the same but simultaneously tries to create new blocks of transactions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Listening nodes (supernodes)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And finally, a sub-category called listening nodes. A listening node, essentially, is a publicly visible full node. It communicates with any node that decides to establish a connection with it. A reliable super node typically runs all the time, transmitting blockchain history and transaction data to multiple nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is the technology that allows the user to &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;create a decentralized system of transaction and data transfers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. For the naïve person, it is a method to create a people’s bank without central banks! Blockchain technology is used in the backend for each cryptocurrency. Talking about that, Blockchain is building the blocks of every critical data and then chaining the blocks. So if the last block or any previous block is changed or updated, then every information in the chain needs to be updated. This makes blockchain technology secure and more robust compared to other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;shared, immutable ledger that felicitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. An investment can be tangible (a house or a car) or intangible (Intellectual property, patents, or copyrights). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks linked together with cryptography which is also described as “trustless and fully decentralized peer to peer immutable data storage which is spread over the network of participants often referred to as the nodes. Every block contains a &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;cryptographic hash of the previous block and the timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and the transaction data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s get back to basics. What is Blockchain, and how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is a file for storing data. Or, to put it in more technical terms, it’s an open, distributed database system. The data is distributed (i.e., duplicated), and the whole Blockchain is entirely decentralized. This means no one person or entity  (say, a government or corporation like Google or Microsoft) has control over the Blockchain;  this is a radical departure from the centralized (Government databases) databases controlled and administered by businesses and other entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? In straightforward terms, the file consists of blocks of data, with each block being connected to the previous block with the hashing code,  forming a chain. Hence, the name &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;“blockchain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As well as the data itself, each block also contains a record of when that block was created or edited. It contains the hash code of the previous block, which makes it very useful for maintaining a complex system of records that cannot be corrupted or lost, and this is the primary use case to preserve the integrity of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the whole Blockchain is duplicated across many computers,  any user can view the entire Blockchain in the case of public blockchains. Transactions or records are processed not by one central administrator but by a network of users who work to verify the data and achieve a consensus; these verifiers are known as miners, each miner is paid some cryptocurrency for successful mining. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Bitcoin operates in the same way. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the first example of Blockchain in action.&lt;/p&gt;
